slope,,,,"One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park <span class=""AS"">Slope</span> (and NY in general)"
squash ravioli,,,,"From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut <span class=""AS"">squash ravioli</span> in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing."
truffle sauce,,,,"From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious <span class=""AS"">truffle sauce</span> to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing."
buttery,,,,"From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing <span class=""AS"">buttery</span> and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing."
langostine entree,,,,"From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender <span class=""AS"">langostine entree</span> to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing."
shell crab,,,,"We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft <span class=""AS"">shell crab</span> as well as the cheese plate.","Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft <span class=""AS"">shell crab</span> hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them.","my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft <span class=""AS"">Shell Crab</span>  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy."
belly dancers,belly dancer,,,"To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the <span class=""AS"">belly dancers</span> and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.","Watch the talented <span class=""AS"">belly dancers</span> as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that's more lemony than smoky."
lamb chop,,,,"I haven't eat a <span class=""AS"">lamb chop</span> as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil."
comfort food,,,,"This is one of the best <span class=""AS"">comfort food</span> places in the city."
check girls,check girl,,,"The only disappointment was the coat <span class=""AS"">check girls</span> who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the coat check girls)."
blend,,,,"Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive <span class=""AS"">blend</span> of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and spices.","The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a <span class=""AS"">blend</span> of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth."
employees,employee,,,"The owners and <span class=""AS"">employees</span> are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.","There are a few Italian <span class=""AS"">employees</span> who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience."
clerks,clerk,,,"Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful <span class=""AS"">clerks</span> there was a dearth of the former too."
ceiling,,,,"The <span class=""AS"">ceiling</span> is amazing!"
falafel,,,,"The chicken and <span class=""AS"">falafel</span> platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad.","Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style <span class=""AS"">falafel</span> wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious."
texture,,,,"Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous <span class=""AS"">texture</span> was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance."
quarters,,,,"Too bad Latin <span class=""AS"">Quarters</span> closed."
traffic area,,,,"We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high <span class=""AS"">traffic area</span> in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty."
parmesan,,,,"(The asparagus, truffle oil, <span class=""AS"">parmesan</span> bruschetta is a winner!)","The eggplant <span class=""AS"">parmesan</span> is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce."

The	O
food	B-ASP

but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O

The	O

the	O

Overall	O
,	O
I	O

that	O
the	O

even	O
exists	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-ASP
are	O
quite	O
decent	O
but	O
then	O
again	O

Right	O

in	O
Brooklyn	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
nice	O
cozy	O
place	O
with	O
good	O
pizza	B-ASP

We	O
thought	O
the	O

would	O
be	O
better	O
,	O
Wrong	O
!	O

Also	O
,	O
do	O

covered	O
in	O

and	O
it	O
turns	O
your	O

black	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
taste	B-ASP
was	O
phenomenal	O

I	O
really	O
liked	O
the	O

compared	O
to	O
their	O

Anyways	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
to	O
eat	O
good	O
food	B-ASP
,	O
I	O
would	O
n't	O
waste	O
my	O
time	O
trying	O
to	O
find	O
something	O
,	O
rather	O
go	O
across	O

Really	O
nice	O
restaurant	B-ASP
to	O
go	O
with	O
a	O

The	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
experience	B-ASP
was	O
knowing	O
that	O
the	O
manager	O
(	O
a	O
bubbly	O
,	O
friendly	O
young	O
woman	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
smile	O
)	O
truly	O
cared	O
about	O
how	O
we	O
were	O
doing	O
.	O

Way	O
too	O
much	O
money	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
terrible	O
meal	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
fish	B-ASP
was	O
adequate	O
,	O
but	O
inexpertly	O
sliced	B-ASP

The	O
staff	B-ASP
are	O
attentive	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
smiles	O
on	O
their	O
faces	O
.	O

Two	O
complaints-	O
their	O
appetizer	B-ASP

,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
mozzarella	O
sticks	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-ASP

I	O
did	O
n't	O
complain	O
,	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-ASP
so	O
much	O
.	O

Great	O

at	O
reasonable	O

After	O

things	O
about	O
the	O
restaurant	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
passing	O
by	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
daily	O
basis	O
,	O
we	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
.	O

So	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
usual	O
bar	O
food	O
,	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
enjoy	O
the	O
menu	B-ASP
while	O
sampling	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
hand	O

Guacamole+shrimp	O

we	O
both	O
had	O
the	O
filet	O
,	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
did	O
n't	O
much	O
like	O
the	O
frites	O
that	O
came	O
with	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
filet	O
was	O
so	O
good	O
,	O
neither	O
of	O
us	O
cared	O

As	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
service	O
goes	O
,	O
the	O
waitresses	B-ASP
were	O
not	O
particularly	O
friendly	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
got	O
the	O
job	O
done	O

The	O
worst	O
though	O
was	O
the	O
taste	B-ASP
.	O

Both	O
times	O
I	O
was	O
extremely	O
dissappointed	O
by	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
,	O
which	O
was	O
boarderline	O
rude	O
.	O

The	O
spicy	O
tuna	B-ASP
roll	I-ASP
was	O
unusually	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
rock	O

THe	O

The	O

All	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
hot	O
tasty	O

All	O
of	O
my	O
co	O
-	O
workers	O
stated	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
amazing	O
and	O
wondered	O
why	O
they	O
had	O
n't	O
heard	O
about	O
this	O

Tell	O
them	O
Herky	O

you	O
and	O
get	O
a	O
free	O
confused	O
look	B-ASP
from	O
the	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O

and	O
the	O
same	O
waitress	B-ASP
looked	B-ASP
at	O
my	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
insane	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
lower	O
reviews	B-ASP
because	O
it	O
is	O
definitely	O
better	O
than	O
other	O
places	O
I	O
have	O
tried	O
with	O
higher	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-ASP
is	O
great	O
if	O
your	O
looking	B-ASP
for	O
a	O
laid	O
back	O
scene	B-ASP
and	O
an	O
inexpensive	O
way	O
to	O
spend	O
a	O
weekend	O
afternoon	O

My	O
chicken	B-ASP
was	O
inedible	O

which	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
keep	O

Oh	O

were	O
out	O
of	O
drinks	B-ASP

which	O
were	O
also	O
delightfully	O
overpriced	O
)	O

Not	O
the	O

The	O

I	O
am	O
relatively	O
new	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
tried	O
Pick	O
a	O
bgel	O
on	O

and	O
was	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O

and	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
overated	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
pricey	O
side	B-ASP
.	O

You	O
will	O
pay	O
a	O
lot	O
for	O
the	O

the	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
no	O
better	O
or	O
worse	O
than	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
other	O
Chinese	O
and	O
Asian	O

The	O

the	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
not	O

but	O
some	O

such	O
as	O
the	O
eggplant	O

It	O

i	O
went	O
in	O
one	O

asking	O
for	O
a	O

for	O
a	O
group	O

was	O
greeted	O
by	O
a	O
very	O
rude	O
hostess	B-ASP

If	O
it	O
seemed	O
possible	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
while	O
there	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
fought	O
my	O

my	O
dinner	B-ASP

my	O

The	O
ambiance	B-ASP
was	O
pretty	O
cool	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
hassle	O

It	O
's	O
true	O

your	O
in	O
a	O

You	O
're	O
going	O

My	O

the	O

(	O

At	O
first	O
I	O
was	O
slightly	O

because	O
it	O

a	O
sushi	B-ASP
restaurant	B-ASP

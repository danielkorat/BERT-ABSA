I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig !
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food .
I was wrong .
Besides , we were on vacation !
From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet .
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off â€“
The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm .
I will go back to Suan soon !
Anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .
Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave.
very good breads as well .
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .
Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere ( Anywhere ) .
Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you do n't want to drop a ton of cash .
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( undercooked ) beef .
Great food , great decor , great service .
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
And that 's no mean feat ...
The food was wonderful and imaginative .
THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS .
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
This place is average ... at best .
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce .
and you ca n't beat the prices .
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car ( I happen to live in Inwood ) .
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
Love YUKA .
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
The food is nothing like its menu description .
Service is fast and friendly .
Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away .
Check it out
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !
Service not the friendliest to our " large party " !
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .
Stick to the gulab jamun .
really depends on your luck !
Service was excellent , and the AC worked very well too ( thank God , it was hot ! ) .
I decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines .
While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .
Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them .
I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it .
- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious ) .
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert , it was overpriced and fell short on taste .
Me and my girls will definitely go back .
I 've been to Sotto Voce several time , and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !
Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ' special ' bagel experience .
And everytime I go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front .
Enjoy !
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment .
For me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside .
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
the waitstaffs are nice though .
I know because I live nearby .
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
Waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well .
Be careful of portions - they 're HUGE .
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
The food is great .
Once for dinner and once for brunch .
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !
Wow .
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
The food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , ( WOW ) you 'll need no more .
If that 's a problem , go to McDonald 's and destroy your insides .
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that 's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd .
( La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico ) .
I reccomend the fried pork dumplings , the orange chicken/beef , and the fried rice .
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs , so be aware .
Definitely a neighborhood favorite .
If you do n't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House .
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
Make more tables - perhaps a rooftop bar ?
Why ?
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .
I have to say the place was awesome .
They have an excellent selection ( the rolls with crab are really great ) .
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
This is n't a value joint .
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .
The sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating ( if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud ) .
The caeser salad was great .
I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing , really good meal .
The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars .
They charge $ 6.00 for rice .
Salads were fantastic .
You ca n't go wrong here .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
I showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .
Very immature bartender , didnt know how to make specific drinks , service was so slowwwww , the food was not fresh or warm , waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .
Terrible experience .
Great Indian food
This place is not worth the prices .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
Have eaten at Ginger House several times , and it 's always good .
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .
Somewhat pricey but what the heck .
$ 500 included :
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .
Unhygienic
This place was the worst .
You will not be missing anything .
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .
The food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
Despite the fact that the space is large , they 've overcrowded the floor with tables .
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .
The staff is also attentive and friendly .
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal .
The service was very attentive and very generous .
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
This place is so much fun .
Whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .
but the food was delicious .
Go with the specials , and stay away from the salmon .
But people from Sichuan will die for it ) - Chongqing Hot Pot , chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan , now became an independent province .
I love it .
Overpriced and not tasty
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
And where does Patis go wrong ; no where .
They have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .
but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers ( nice non-sushi selection ) .
( i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood . . )
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
Save room for deserts - they 're to die for .
Everything a NY pizza joint should be .
I do n't think I would go again .
even the wine by the glass was good .
it helps if you know what to order .
We were wondering why they were there to make our dining experience miserable ?
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
Best Chinese on the Upper East , prompt delivery , good value .
I 've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer .
When we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong .
However , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street .
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .
Tiny dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special , we limited ourselves to several appetizers .
We left , never to return .
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps .
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive ( considering we were the only ones there for the first hour ) .
You ca n't go wrong with this place .
We will definitely go back .
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
Reliable , Fresh Sushi
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE .
But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
It 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
The service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I 've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar .
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .
the icing MADE this cake , it was fluffy , not ultra sweet , creamy and light .
great hot dogs . .
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .
Even with John 's and Joe 's around the corner , this place will make a name for itself .
Oh , and I never write reviews -- I just was so moved by how bad this place was , I felt it was my duty to spread the word .
But the staff was so horrible to us .
The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York .
Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave.
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
We were very pleasantly surprised .
The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect .
Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side .
I loved it and would go again .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water .
Everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city .
The second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners .
came here for restaurant week , did n't save much , but it was still great .
Not pretentious and very economical .
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
I love this place .
Staff is accomodating make sure you are satified .
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .
Great food , good wine and an excellent host .
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
We left after one drink .
Only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good .
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz 's Deli down on the Lower East Side .
However , the food and service and dramatically lacking .
But the staff was so horrible to us .
The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .
This establishment is the real deal .
Come on .
No dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
I would highly recommend it .
The service is awful -- the last time I was there ( and I do mean the last time ) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place ( PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES ) .
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
The service is great ( maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention ) , the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good ...
A defitely must visit .
Will give it another chance before I write it off .
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions .
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The
In addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable .
I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion !
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .
Decor is charming .
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
Looking from the outside in , one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall ( really , that 's what it is ) .
I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner , but nothing amazing .
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .
The ' kamasutra ' and ' bombay cosmopolitan ' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time .
Both are delicious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand .
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .
The wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindly little european town .
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .
Chance is a joke .
Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly , helpful , and willing to the extra mile for a customer .
The pizza 's are made fresh , crispy , and ready to serve .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
Consistently good Japanese Tapas .
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
Also very inexpensive .
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .
Anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list .
Ambience is delightful , service impeccable .
Be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it !
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .
I do not recommend .
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine , and have been going back regularly ever since .
The best burger I have had in the Village .
It is bland and nothing extrodinary .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
A weakness is the chicken in the salads .
Go for the Seafood Paella for two .
everything is scrumptious , from the excellent service by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush atmosphere .
My boyfriend and I went here last night and LOVED it !
The food is great , service is ok .
Everytime I go there I ca n't pick anything to eat and not because the menu is filled with great things to eat .
Definately check it out !!!
You can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .
Dessert is a joke ... dont bother
I am Indian , and I have tried many Indian places in NY .
Good drink .
If you go here , do it on his off-night .
" The menu includes pub fare -- burgers , steaks and shepherds pie -- and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as " vegetarians .
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish .
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
We left , never to return .
My friend told me about this restaurant for a year before he finally took me this weekend .
The decor is what initially got me in the door .
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .
The specials are usually quite good too .
They charge different prices all the time .
I had the best ravioli ever .
Have eaten at Ginger House several times , and it 's always good .
The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant .
The food there are sastifying .
We were not disappointed .
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .
The service was dreadfully slow ( the place was only half full ) and a smile would have been nice ...
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .
Tiny restaurant with very fast service .
Never again !
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch !
When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years .
Its located in greenewich village .
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
It is simply amazing .
I 've been to Joya twice and I will never go again .
We went to Ino for Valentines .
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .
I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade .
The room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .
It was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .
I went to Common Stock for brunch and I was so impressed .
What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .
Once we sailed , the top-notch food and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening .
For being number 1 , this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation .
Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .
Save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to Margharita 's on Washington Street instead , they have amazing food and the BEST service .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
It 's no-fuss , fast and delicious .
Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best ( I hope Mom does n't read this ! ) .
MMmmm ... it was delicious .
It is expensive but well worth the money .
Service was among the best I have ever had in NYC .
This is the best thing in Soho .
Everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once .
To sum it up : Service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok .
In the summer months , the back garden area is really nice .
How is this palce still open ?
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST !
I read about this place in Time Out magazine .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
But , nothing stands out about the cooking .
So we sat at the bar , the bartender did n't seem like he wanted to be there .
If you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
But the meals were terrible .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
Over price , and small portions .
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .
you guys rock .
Also , they do not take credit card so come with cash !
Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people .
The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting .
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
The service was ok .
The staff offers impeccable service .
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
Ambiance - relaxed and stylish .
The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .
i recommend the thai popcorn : )
They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the gnocchi -- yum !
Since I cook for a living , I 'm very fussy about the food I eat in restaurants .
Too bad Latin Quarters closed .
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
For a Fabulous Wedding !
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
I 'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much .
The lox is always fresh too .
Also get the Onion Rings -- best we 've ever had .
excellent tapas at great prices , romantic , small but not overly crowed , excellent
The family seafood entree was very good .
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
Because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .
I 've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I 've been sitting there while he lectured another customer .
My friends and I stop here for pizza before hitting the Kips Bay movie theater .
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .
While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .
For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !
My Chelsea 's impressive and creative menu includes modern , Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean , Jap style hamburger steak , spicy cod roe spaghetti , black cod with miso base , and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce , to name a few .
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
The food is good .
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .
Complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff .
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
My husband and I take out from here 3-4 times a month .
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .
I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more !
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be .
When he 's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms , he 's visiting the regulars ( a growing legion ) and checking on newcomers .
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .
Romantic if you want it to be ( brightly lit ) .
Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished .
Just ignore the trendy wannabes .
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating .
The food was very good , but not very thai .
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
The bagel was huge .
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
Malted Milk Ball Gelato - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful ?
Everything on the menu is great .
Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence !
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday .
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
We were then shooed inside .
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable .
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early .
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
Everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .
I 'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we 're repeat customers .
The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad ( including asking for salad dressing ) and was instead given a quesedilla .
The crispy chicken was n't for us , though .
For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , " can I help you " and " how many are in your party . "
However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT .
I was a little leary about Mary 's at first - it 's small , crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I 'm glad I finally tried it .
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
The main entree was also very good .
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .
I had the cod with paella ( spicy and very filling , I 'm a big eater and could only eat half ) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips ( again , a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries ) .
I come here enjoy very much with husband .
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free desserts .
The food was bland oily .
I often go there to eat with my family .
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from , but we had been there less than an hour and they had n't even brought us a check yet !
Ca nâ€™t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .
Go here .
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .
Unfortunately , we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport .
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .
The food was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .
I was pleasantly suprised .
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they 're doing .
Not a small feat for good french food in the area .
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .
and i have been around the block , to say the very least .
This place is Italian , not French .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies .
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years .
Always great service !
We live nearby BFC .
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .
No plans to return anytime soon .
Warning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !
I would not recommend this place to anyone .
Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .
It was totally overpriced - fish and chips was about $ 15 ....
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .
Unique apppetizers .
I was speechless by the horrible food .
They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz ' Deli , or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants .
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place ( the first being Joya ) .
Go here if you want fresh and tasty salads of any type you can imagine .
I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .
Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu .
Perhaps .
Not too crazy about their sake martini .
The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .
The avocado salad is a personal fave .
The food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great .
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito ( or tacos ) , margarita , and dessert .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
And , the honey BBQ rib tips are yummy !
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .
If you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .
The chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( I have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken .
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .
Vanison was good but not amazing .
The food was authentic .
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
Maybe the secret was that we went on a Sunday night and everything was great .
Too bad Latin Quarters closed .
The wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .
( Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .
Bring your date and a bottle of wine !
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow .
Try sushimi cucumber roll .
We will be back .
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .
One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood .
The food was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options .
Restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place .
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .
The main course had an average portion , and was decent overall .
Seriously , this place kicks ass .
Always a nice crowd , but never loud .
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal .
The food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .
I 'll be back soon .
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they do n't make you by bottles .
We 'd go back again
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
A very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin ' Greens salads , Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
Not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002 .
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual .
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
The design of the space is good .
Monday nights are a bargain at the $ 28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus * three * glasses of wine paired with each course .
Please take my advice , go and try this place .
We had Lava Cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it .
Authentic bistro !
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
For great chinese food nearby , you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away .
I do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $ 400.00 where I am not swept off my feet .
And it was quick which is very important .
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
After a seafood craving , i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info .
Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
Everything about this place is adorable - even the bathroom !
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .
Service has always been friendly and efficient .
The food was bland oily .
Nothing special about this place .
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things .
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer .
Favourites include : potato spinach gnocchi and the lamb .
NO PIZZA 33 for me !
That place was awesome , , , sally !
There are other people waiting !
Though it 's been crowded most times I 've gone here , Bark always delivers on their food .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly .
They have wheat crusted pizza made with really fresh and yummy ingredients .
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says I love you .
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must .
really depends on your luck !
JUST AWSOME .
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30 .
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .
The menu is great , with a good selection , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .
This place does n't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does , but it should .
The place was quiet and delightful .
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view !
A nice space , as long as it does n't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers .
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .
Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .
I 've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I 've been going .
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
You will find yourself returning quite often .
Service is great , takeout is good too .
I like Mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .
Will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
Tends to turn people away .
Overall , the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves .
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .
The food was authentic .
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .
Terrible Waste of money . . scammers
The ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed .
Nice for one time special occasion .
For those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n't get it .
Host and Hostess was quite rude .
Try the Peanut Butter Sorbet and the pizza with soy cheese !
The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
This is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business !
The best pad thai i 've ever had .
When you want a piece of beef , head on over .
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .
There are many french bistros in the midtown area , and I wholheartedly recommend this one .
The Dim Sum was so-so , but not spectacular .
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .
Stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds ( hint hint ) .
A must try !
Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe .
A great addition to Smith Street : finally , a place that 's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots .
If you 're lucky and there 's not a private party going on back there , you 'll get a chance to really chill out .
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ...
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .
The pizza here is delicious .
I 've never been treated so rudely .
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .
Cantinetta is a real treasure in a see of mediocre Italian restaurants .
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .
The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .
Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
Good food .
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
and never strayed .
This place was reccomended to me by a friend .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
There are other people waiting !
Result ( red velvet ) : Great texture , soft and velvety , nice hint of cocoa .
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious !
All-time favorites include the Big Mac , Chicken McNuggets , Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald 's famous french fries ; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available .
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .
The food is amazing ... especially if you get the Chef 's tasting menu and your favourite bottle ( or two ! ) of wine from an extensive selection of wines .
Also , the staff is very attentive and really personable .
The noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible .
Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( stacks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .
Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers .
Instead of wasting your time here : SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD .
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place !
i dont know what some people who rave about this hot dog are talking about .
They are by far the BEST past in New York .
After waiting for almost an hour , the waiter brusquely told us he 'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order .
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .
My friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !
How have I never been to Agave before ?
They are FAST .
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning .
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .
The sushi is amazing !!!
and there 's no way out .
The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) .
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional .
When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
From the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious .
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .
This restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .
Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
Somewhat disappointing wine list ( only new vintages .
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out .
Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience .
I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE FOOD .
Delicious crab cakes too .
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .
Try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .
The cold sesame noodles , which are a freebie when you order $ 10 + , are delectable .
Please be aware that it 's CASH or AMEX only !
Dessert : pure disaster .
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !
Some baby pizzas get their wish .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
Went there for an office lunch .
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .
Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
More Williamsburg Garbage
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust , around a raw and cold inside .
Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming .
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year .
The wait staff was loud and inconsiderate .
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .
Found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .
Really .
Between my guest and I , we sampled at least 80 % of the menu , and they were all hits .
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite .
A + + The service was good to excellent along with the attitude .
It is also extremely well priced .
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .
It 's easy to get a table for a large group and you do n't get hustled out .
first it took us a long time to find the place .
please do n't fool us .
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .
Drinks way over priced .
And the bill was outragous .
Located at the end of a magnificent block .
I loved it .
He always says , I do n't have customers .
Best Indian Chinese in the city , by far !
But now that it 's under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great .
The place is absolutely adorable and the food is delicious .
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
The portions are very large and the service is fantastic !!
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .
but the service was a bit slow .
I go twice a month !
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge steaks , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .
The sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone .
A big disappointment , all around .
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris .
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED .
This place is a must visit !
Amma is nothing special .
I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it does n't really matter .
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
The service is descent even when this small place is packed .
You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting .
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years .
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , food was well-prepared and - presented and the service was pleasant and prompt .
The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there .
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy , s food is expensive but it 's new york !
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .
I could n't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher .
The hostess said " Wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together " , to which I replied " no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . "
Good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch .
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .
The palak paneer was standard , and I was not a fan of the malai kofta .
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
Stay away
The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( do n't waste any of your calories ) and service was poor .
We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .
My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon .
Service was wonderful ;
The food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .
I was there on sat .
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip .
I pray it stays open forever .
It also has lots of other Korean dishes that are affordable and just as yummy .
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .
This place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .
The atmosphere is warm , comfortable , artsy and sexy .
Too bad , has a lot of potential .
The bagel was huge .
And I could do without the cigar smoke .
This place is a great bargain .
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !
Stay far away from this place .
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
Culinaria is a welcome addition to the Garment district - far better than any restaurant in the area .
Coffee is a better deal than overpriced Cosi sandwiches .
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this was n't a place we 'd return to .
Over 100 different choices to create your own .
We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
Always popular , always full , always a wait .
The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth .
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular .
The menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .
They have very quick service which is great when you do n't have much time .
I 'm from England , and Haru 's was the best I had in NYC .
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food .
fine dining restaurant quality .
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
Nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 3.25 too .
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , I understood they were busy .
Try the green curry !!!
It 's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger .
However , I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling .
The dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .
It can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .
The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .
I do n't get it either .
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .
Fantastic place .
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .
Wine list is not huge but def well selected .
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .
The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
Oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were !
To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .
Went there for an office lunch .
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
Service - friendly and attentive .
Joe 's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up .
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .
Also , I personally was n't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY -- I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
Everything we had was good or ok .... but definitely nothing great .
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
Seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .
The fish was really , really fresh .
I HATE HATE HATE this place .
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters - you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in .
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table .
Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .
Beware of the chili signed food items not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth .
After we ate our appetizers ( which took all of 8 minutes ) we ordered another round of Brahma 's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .
The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .
The pastas were pretty good .
Get it together .
Prices are in line .
Food was average but tasty .
They were dry , stale and pretty flavorless .
We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .
Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .
Finally , after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be .
Montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here .
The service was attentive .
This is the Cheers of New York , whether you 've ever been there or not .
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout ... Lamb Chops , Veal Chops , Rabbit , the potato gratin , on and on and on ...
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .
P.S. Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge .
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .
We asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers .
First of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .
His food is excellent ( and not expensive by NYC standards - no entrees over $ 30 , most appetizers $ 12 to 14 ) .
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
Quite simply it 's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .
Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait , when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .
It is also extremely well priced .
Way below average
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared .
I just do n't understand all the hype ...
After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the dish was supposed to taste like .
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews , but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people .
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .
This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard
Food is always fresh and hot - ready to eat !
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection .
Prices are in line .
The food 's as good as ever .
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .
It 's a really great deal , considering we got full off of four dollars .
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back , in a veyr good sense .
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A.
This is one of my favorite spot , very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized .
Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
Great staff .
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place !
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices .
I went to Del Frisco 's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation .
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .
Definite go if you 're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad .
Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead .
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it .
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
If you can handle that , it 's a great place for a business dinner , fun with friends or simply a table for 2 .
When you enter , you feel like you have entered your mom 's kitchen .
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers , right off of Pell St ( barber 's alley ) in Chinatown .
Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - does n't meet the bill .
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .
One caveat : Some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh .
Cool atmosphere but such a let down .
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
I absolutely Loved this place .
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !
Hats off to the chef .
Good food at the right price , what more can you ask for .
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare .
In fact there is only one I 've tried that even compares ( shabu Tatsu ) and even then I prefer Dokebi .
Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad .
Great find !!!
Try the sea bass .
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .
Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central .
Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I 'm in NYC .
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .
Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .
I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .
Appetizers took nearly an hour .
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .
The BEST Chinese food Uptown !
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix .
The menu , which changes seasonally , shows both regional and international influences .
MY date and I both ordered the Branzini and both felt the fish was very average .
I go here at least once every other week , particularly when it 's cold !
Check this place out !
Two words : Free wine .
So if you want a nice , enjoyable meal at Montparnasse , go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe .
Weekends can get crowded , but still highly recommended .
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar .
They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .
The lunch special is an asbolute steal .
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever .
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good )
I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino 's blows my families receipies away .
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced .
The wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindly little european town .
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
The wine the service was very good too .
Recommended .
And the food was fantastic .
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
and we were thouroughly disapointed .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
Excellent food for great prices
I do n't remember what we had ; nothing was memorable .
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . (
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing .
I went to Ruby Foo 's after work with a group of 6 .
If it 's just a quick martini at the bar ( which I recommend Jeffery 's ) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...
The food was well prepared and the service impecable .
First , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which I would have chosen had I known about them .
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
Went for Mom 's birthday brunch/lunch .
Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .
Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .
Slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .
The menu has so many fish items and oysters .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch .
This place is always packed .
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food .
Warning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .
The place was quiet and delightful .
Our waiter was fine , the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .
Fish was overdone .
The food is great .
now called nikki sushi , sushi is OK .
The service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .
We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!
I 've been a regular customer at Juice Generation for the last 3 months - my office moved to the Film Center on Ninth Avenue and they are on the next block .
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I 've tried similar dishes at .
And the prices were way to high for what you get .
We did n't even see a menu , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes .
We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful .
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
The staff is very kind and well trained , they 're fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations .
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats , except at Taj Mahal .
He served me an Uni Hand roll , which I never had before , and let me tell you ... IT WAS HEAVEN !
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
This place has great indian chinese food .
The music was fascinating , but left room for conversation , and the bartender made superb drinks .
It was a very nice surprise .
When it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time , walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted ... excuse me but is n't that his job ???
I had a great experience .
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .
The hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .
I have dined at Mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter .
Not impressed with the food .
The decor is very simple but comfortable .
keep up the good work .
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies .
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it .
Decor is charming .
This is a real gem of a place .
Very pleased
The owner truly caters to all your needs .
Worth a visit .
The place is a lot of fun .
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
In fact , this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable .
This place has the best sushi in the city .
The wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she 's - way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way ) .
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT 's .
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef Yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte .
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way ...
However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
I was pleasantly suprised .
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese .... both very tasty .
Service was prompt and courteous .
This was a great surprise .
The food we ordered was excellent , although I would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .
The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat .
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .
this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend .
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza ( at least I do n't think they ever made it before this year ) ... but it was worth the wait .
Never fails to please .
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )
What a great place .
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .
We all ate pasta entre'es , which were great .
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
The place is a lot of fun .
Every time I visit NYC , I come here .
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .
While there 's a decent menu , it should n't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza .
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .
this restaurant is absolutely beautiful .
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .
Very " normal Indian food " , but done really well .
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .
We live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened .
Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
Not only is the service great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable .
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
Great selection of wine , and seafood .
Chinatown definitely has better quality with cheaper prices .
Service was good and food is wonderful .
Then , IF they answer the phone , you 're lucky if they do n't hang up on you !
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected .
I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit .
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city .
The food is great , I love their dumplings , cold sesame noodles , chicken and shrimp dishs .
We go often .
They outshine HH .
When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .
I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food .
We love it , and took buses and cabs to get there .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !
I have eaten a lot of pizza here .
We loved it and will go back !
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
But the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing .
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
Very good service and very good prices .
I have eaten a lot of pizza here .
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I 've had .
We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , I felt there was more than enough food .
When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside , she recommended that we go to this restaurant .
My wife and I went to Water 's Edge for a romantic dinner .
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .
A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
The price very reasonable .
I will NEVER return .
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
If you 're looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to Del Frisco 's !
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
You wo n't be dissapointed .
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
Great beer selection too , something like 50 beers .
You will not be disapointed at all .
The wine list is excellent .
we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
I highly recommend this beautiful place .
I lived on 50th st , and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out .
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look .
The seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair .
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .
During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice .
If you want to dine with large party , I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT .
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend .
There restaurant is very casual , but perfect for lunch , and their delivery service is always very fast .
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their wine list .
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone , but they were out of it that day .
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !
If you are a carnivore , come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been .
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
Reasonably priced with very fresh sushi .
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience .
My entire family was horrified .
The drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves .
Did I mention the wine ?
Sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive .
Avoid this place !
Gigino 's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable .
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
In any event , even though its a bit on the pricey side , we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back .
Cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out !!!!
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .
For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion , I do prefer smaller , quiter restaurants .
Also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side .
Give it a try , menu is typical French but varied .
Everything about this place was wonderful .
We had a girls ' night dinner here for restaurant week .
Definitely something to come down and check out .
This place is great .
Leave the kids at home !
The portions of the food that came out were mediocre .
It 's only $ 1.95 for a regular slice and $ 4.00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms .
Look elsewhere .
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce .
Very good value
The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !
$ 170 down the toilet ...
The pizza was really good .
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible !
The sake menu should not be overlooked !
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .
What you are paying for is the environment and the name .
When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's .
This place is always packed .
Will never be back .
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for .
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .
I take all my NYC guests to VT 's .
I 've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST .
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine 's dinner .
Disappointing food , lousy service .
And Kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across .
Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love .
Over the years , it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine .
The food is delicious and the bar has a great vibe .
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !
do n't get me wrong - sushi was good , just not fantastic .
they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .
A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .
Ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .
Outstanding Bagels , but you get what you pay for .
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch .
Highly recommended .
The $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great .
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !
I would n't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .
go here for the drinks !
We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .
And the food , well the food will keep you coming back .
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .
The guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .
I 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait .
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
I go twice a month !
You can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
SUM IT : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village .
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience .
Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody .
Spice is sleek , modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet .
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .
Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .
The only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time .
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
during busy hrs , i recommend that you make a reservation .
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had !
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of flavor .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
perfect for a quick meal .
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary .
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .
Overall , I 'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its Chinatown .
My gf 's duck confitte was very solid as well , although i have little base of reference .
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy .
We thought the dessert would be better , Wrong !
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
It does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish .
Overall , worht every penny .
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .
I would highly recommend .
Really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date .
At 6:30 , we were the third party there .
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .
Way too much money for such a terrible meal .
The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
The staff are attentive , and have smiles on their faces .
I am going to the mid town location next .
Two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .
I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
Zero ambiance to boot .
Plenty of choices to make your own creation .
Great food at reasonable prices .
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .
So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers .
Guacamole + shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .
Go girls !!!
So sorry I ca n't rate this better .
As far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .
The worst though was the taste .
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
i 've noticed megadeth , mr. scruff , st. germain , traditional vietnamese songs , black sabbath , jay-z , and daft punk all being played .
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge .
The folding chair I was seated at was uncomfortable .
All the food was hot tasty .
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place .
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter .
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .
I am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings .
For those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n't get it .
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .
A guaranteeed delight !
For $ 760 for 2 people , it 's a once in a lifetime experience .
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town .
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
Try the sea bass .
Food is excellent .
go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !
Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) .
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
I am French and I really felt like home !!!
Stay away if you 're claustrophobic
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ' that ' couple .
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .
great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood ...
We all felt it was worth it .
Good luck getting a table .
mojitos and the service are the best part in there
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
Maybe it has improved since then ?
This place is worth an one-hour drive .
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .
You will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
I went there after hearing how great it was .
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal .
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
Love it .
LOL
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .
You have to increase the service a lot .
DO not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .
I 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .
They treat me like family , morning and night .
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee .
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you !
This is also where I was from .
A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town .
Love YUKA .
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .
I was highly disappointed by their service and food .
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
I 've waited over one hour for food .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
even the wine by the glass was good .
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .
Overall , this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time I have been .
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
I 've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .
The staff is arrogant , the prices are way high for Brooklyn .
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly .
We were pleasantly greeted .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience !!!
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
I am bringing my whole family back next time .
Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .
The wine list is extensive and impressive .
A pleasant surprise .
Stay with the roasted chickens and you 'll be fine .
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat , of any food group - hands down
The waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large .
AMAZING MY FAVORITE !!!
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
The food was boring and expensive .
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished .
moral stay away .
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .
All in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .
We 've tried before but it always packed and does n't take reservations .
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
Service is top notch .
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .
Emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go .
For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc. ...
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet .
Not to be overlooked , the service is excellent .
the spinach is fresh , definately not frozen ...
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
I recommend this place to everyone .
Do not go to this restaurant .
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
But the pizza is way to expensive .
If you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what Rao 's is all about .
We wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .
I love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience .
Delicious , creative and fun .
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
However , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .
You will be very happy with the experience .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .
Their duck here is also absolutely delicious .
Everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food .
Great wine list , reasonably priced . -- Sara
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor .
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30 .
What a difference , the service was very comforting and the food was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list .
Dumbfoundingly Poor
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good ( kimono shrimp special was excellent ) and has a great atmosphere .
Sandwiches , burgers and salads , like the lemon-dressed cobb , are classic successes .
Perfectly al dente pasta , not drowned in sauce -- generous portions .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
All in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks !!!!
I went here for a family birthday dinner .
I 've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens .
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .
The steak is good , the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great .
Even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow .
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .
Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .
Love the scene first off - the place has a character and nice light to it . . very fortunate , location wise .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
Mazing interior .
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it !
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
Pricey , but worth a try , at least once .
They 've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods .
Salads were fantastic .
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
The sauces used are also not that exciting .
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
my picks are : - Scallion Pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style ( one of my personal favorites ) - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish ( this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .
We will go back every time we are in the City .
The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start .
We 'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night .
Our food was great too !
Tables are close , so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons .
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .
Having discovered Ping 's on the internet , we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in .
It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .
It hits the spot every time
Probably would not go back here .
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .
The one vegetarian entree ( Abby 's treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .

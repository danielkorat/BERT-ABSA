If	O
anything	O

I	O
would	O
only	O
suggest	O
using	O
one	O
of	O
these	O

if	O
only	O
you	O
have	O
to	O

I	O
love	O
this	O

and	O
use	O
it	O
everyday	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
lets	O
me	O
down	O

Instead	O
,	O
I	O
'll	O
focus	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
actual	O
performance	B-ASP
and	I-ASP
feature	I-ASP
set	I-ASP
of	I-ASP
the	I-ASP
hardware	I-ASP
itself	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
make	O
an	O
educated	O
decision	O
on	O
which	O
Mac	O
to	O
buy	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
motherboard	B-ASP
again	O
so	O
soon	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
replace	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
made	O
the	O
right	O
decision	O
.	O

The	O
nicest	O
part	O
is	O
the	O
low	O
heat	B-ASP
output	I-ASP
and	O
ultra	O
quiet	O

The	O
OS	B-ASP

and	O
offers	O
all	O

It	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
operate	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
ordered	O
more	O
software	B-ASP

for	O
my	O

it	O
is	O
very	O
easy	O
for	O
anyone	O
to	O
use	B-ASP
an	O
apple	O
and	O
specially	O
the	O
mcbook	O

I	O
would	O
rather	O
spend	O
my	O

on	O
a	O

a	O

I	O
also	O
did	O

how	O
the	O

because	O
it	O
may	O
have	O
a	O

they	O
went	O

it	O
is	O
just	O
a	O

it	O
does	O
not	O
affect	O

at	O
all	O

I	O
just	O

were	O
told	O
it	O

The	O
Mac	B-ASP

One	O
of	O
the	O

thing	O

My	O
wife	O
recently	O
purchased	O
an	O
Apple	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
and	O
our	O
granddaughter	O
fell	O
in	O
love	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
asked	O
for	O
one	O
for	O
her	O
birthday	O
.	O

THIS	O
is	O
what	O
a	O
laptop	O
is	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O

I	O
can	O
throw	O

So	O
if	O
anyones	O
looking	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
computer	O
or	O
laptop	O
you	O
should	O
stay	O

far	O
away	O
from	O
any	O
that	O
have	O
the	O
name	O
TOSHIBA	O
on	O
it	O
...	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
from	O
HSN	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
"	O
bundled	O
"	O
with	O
extra	O
software	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
software	B-ASP
just	O
crashes	O
it	O
more	O
often	O
.....	O

We	O
carry	O
the	O
netbook	O
around	O
here	O

there	O

hence	O
it	O
's	O
kinda	O
of	O
irritating	O
when	O
the	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
resolution	B-ASP

the	I-ASP

n't	O
high	O
enough	O
for	O

But	O
on	O
a	O
lazy	O
Saturday	O

this	O

some	O
of	O
the	O

sushi	B-ASP
I	O

it	O

that	O

I	O

we	O
were	O
well	O
taken	O

We	O
all	O
ate	O

My	O

the	O

The	O

Every	O
time	O
I	O
visit	O
NYC	O

so	O
tiny	O
,	O
two	O
people	B-ASP

trouble	O
sharing	O
one	O

While	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
decent	O
menu	B-ASP
,	O
it	O
should	O
n't	O
take	O
ten	O

The	O
appetizers	O
are	O
just	O
OK	O

the	O

She	O

a	O
small	O

but	O
I	O
guess	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
too	O
busy	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
fit	O
a	O
group	O

The	O
owners	B-ASP

are	O

Not	O
only	O
is	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
great	O
,	O
but	O
forming	O
conversation	O
around	O
a	O

is	O
so	O
easy	O
beacuse	O
the	O

can	O
be	O
both	O

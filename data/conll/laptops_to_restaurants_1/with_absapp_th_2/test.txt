The	O
real	O
problem	O
I	O
had	O
with	O
this	O

was	O
the	O

there	O
to	O

I	O
could	O

the	O

The	O

There	O
are	O
other	O

you	O
can	O

about	O
those	O

I	O
got	O
an	O
excellent	O
piece	O
of	O
cheesecake	B-ASP

we	O
had	O
several	O

Finally	O
a	O
reliable	O
Chinese	O
restaurant	O

I	O
would	O
n't	O
even	O
have	O
complained	O
at	O
all	O
if	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
at	O

tasted	O
good	O
but	O
the	O
quality	B-ASP
of	I-ASP
food	I-ASP
was	O
crappy	O
,	O
too	O

We	O
could	O
n't	O
carry	O
our	O
conversation	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
routinely	O
interrupted	O
by	O
waitress	B-ASP
and	O
servants	B-ASP
asking	O
us	O
to	O
order	O
and	O
hinting	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
taking	O
too	O
much	O

can	O
take	O
it	O
a	O
bit	O
seriously	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
should	O
n't	O

The	O
guac	B-ASP
is	O
fresh	O

I	O
've	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
times	O

The	O

The	O

early	O
at	O
5pm	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
very	O

We	O
thought	O
the	O
dessert	B-ASP
would	O
be	O
better	O
,	O
Wrong	O

Also	O
,	O
do	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O

was	O
overated	O

on	O

You	O
will	O
pay	O
a	O

the	O

This	O

the	O

online	O
review	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
made	O
about	O
a	O
restaurant	O
in	O
my	O
life	O

Everyone	O
was	O
smiling	O
so	O
that	O
made	O
me	O
feel	O
welcome	O

Pricey	O
,	O
but	O
worth	O
a	O
try	O
,	O
at	O

once	O
.	O

No	O
thanks	O
!!!	O

I	O
only	O
tried	O
a	O
simple	O
dish	O
of	O
spinach	B-ASP
ravioli	I-ASP
in	I-ASP
a	I-ASP
light	I-ASP
oil	I-ASP
and	I-ASP
garlic	I-ASP
sauce	I-ASP
,	O
but	O
it	O
actually	O
faired	O
better	O
than	O
most	O
NYC	O
Italian	O
joints	O
I	O
've	O
tried	O
similar	O
dishes	O
at	O
.	O

I	O
'd	O
be	O
horrified	O
if	O
my	O
staff	B-ASP
were	O
turning	O
away	O
customers	O
so	O
early	O
and	O
so	O
rudely	O
!	O

The	O
dinner	B-ASP
was	O
ok	O
,	O
nothing	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
again	O
.	O

Nice	O
place	O
though	O
.	O

Kenny	O
the	O
owner	B-ASP
is	O
always	O
there	O
and	O
he	O
treats	O
my	O

we	O
are	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
family	O
.	O

Other	O
apetizers	B-ASP
and	O
food	B-ASP

I	O
think	O
I	O
've	O
had	O
some	O
the	O
best	O
meals	B-ASP
of	O
my	O
life	O
at	O
minnow	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
lobster	B-ASP
sandwich	I-ASP
and	O
it	O
was	O
FANTASTIC	O
.	O

The	O
lack	O
of	O
AC	B-ASP
and	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
million	O
swarming	O
bodies	O
(	O
although	O
everyone	O
is	O
polite	O
and	O
no	O
one	O
is	O
pushing	O
)	O
is	O
a	O
slight	O
turn	O
off	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
taken	O
aback	O
,	O
as	O
this	O
seemed	O
to	O
present	O
a	O
problem	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
restaurant	O
looked	O
fairly	O
empty	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
hastily	O
put	O
the	O
table	O
together	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

No	O
,	O
really	O
.	O

To	O
dine	O
at	O
Thalia	O
can	O
be	O
slightly	O
deceiving	O
because	O
while	O
its	O
beautiful	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
,	O
its	O
so	O
bland	O
on	O
the	O
inside	O

It	O

I	O
would	O

Been	O
going	O
here	O
since	O
it	O
opened	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
quality	B-ASP
value	I-ASP
decrease	O
considerably	O

They	O

the	O

food	B-ASP
and	O
refleshment	B-ASP
with	O
my	O

My	O
biggest	O
complaint	O
was	O
the	O
un-tasty	O
food	B-ASP
although	O
presented	O
well	O
.	O

SEA	O
has	O
become	O
so	O
popular	O
that	O
they	O
've	O

it	O

The	O
waitstaff	B-ASP
were	O
attentive	O

an	O
impressive	O

in	O

close	O

Always	O
a	O
nice	O
crowd	B-ASP

but	O
never	O
loud	O

Have	O
been	O
dozens	O
of	O
times	O
and	O
never	O
failed	O
to	O
enjoy	O
the	O
experience	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
glad	O
I	O
was	O
introduced	O
to	O
this	O
place	B-ASP
and	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O
gem	O
in	O
NY	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
ordinary	O
and	O
the	O
beef	B-ASP

Do	O
n't	O
look	O
down	O
your	O

It	O
's	O
super-trendy	O
and	O
there	O
's	O
always	O
someone	O
to	O
take	O
that	O
empty	O
seat	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
customer	O
service	B-ASP
has	O
been	O
deemed	O
not	O
of	O
the	O
essence	O
.	O

Not	O
only	O
is	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
great	O
,	O
but	O
forming	O
conversation	O
around	O
a	O
table	O
is	O
so	O
easy	O
beacuse	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-ASP
can	O
be	O
both	O
romantic	O
and	O
comfortable	O
.	O

Here	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
zen	B-ASP
feel	I-ASP
without	O
feeling	O
rigid	O

There	O
is	O
a	O

of	O

This	O

The	O

All	O
in	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

was	O
the	O
mayonaisse	B-ASP
for	O
my	O
side	O
of	O

I	O
received	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
runners	I-ASP

which	O
is	O
not	O
good	O
considering	O
the	O
bill	B-ASP
was	O
nearly	O
$	O
100	O

Would	O
not	O
return	O

I	O
just	O

Now	O
I	O
could	O

will	O
probably	O
work	O
a	O

You	O

if	O
you	O

you	O
can	O
connect	O
and	O
download	O
songs	O
to	O
it	O
at	O
high	O

This	O
is	O
likely	O
due	O
to	O
poor	O
grounding	O
and	O
isolation	O
between	O

and	O
I	O
'm	O
hoping	O
that	O

can	O
be	O
fixed	O

I	O
still	O
expected	O
better	O
product	B-ASP
quality	B-ASP
for	O
this	O

If	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
case	B-ASP

then	O
I	O

figure	O
that	O
after	O
everything	O

it	O
was	O

is	O
what	O
I	O
did	O

check	O

The	O

The	O

for	O
the	O

this	O

I	O
have	O
to	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
call	O

ask	O
for	O
a	O
recovery	O

redo	O
it	O
all	O

do	O
not	O

you	O
will	O

that	O

my	O

complaint	O

My	O
battery	B-ASP
went	O
bad	O
about	O
a	O

a	O
half	O
after	O

it	O

Yes	O
,	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
thing	B-ASP

but	O
it	O
's	O
made	O
from	O

I	O

a	O

The	O
only	O
thing	B-ASP

I	O
was	O

that	O
it	O

we	O

They	O
really	O
do	O
have	O

I	O
've	O
had	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
2	O
months	O
now	O
and	O
found	O
no	O
issues	O
with	O

It	O
's	O
great	O
to	O
have	O
a	O

I	O
have	O
an	O

it	O
just	O
made	O
sense	O
to	O
finish	O
off	O

the	O

The	O
only	O
thing	B-ASP
I	O
miss	O
is	O
that	O
my	O

I	O
will	O
also	O
say	O
it	O
is	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
I	O

Do	O
yourself	O
a	O
favor	O

if	O
you	O
are	O
planning	O
on	O
purchasing	O
this	O

(	O
Beware	O
,	O
their	O
staff	O
could	O
send	O
you	O
back	O
making	O
you	O
feel	O
that	O
only	O
they	O
know	O
what	O
a	O
computer	O
is	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
now	O
trying	O
to	O
decide	O
on	O
another	O
Dell	O
model	O

Had	O
to	O
have	O
this	O
computer	O
repaired	O
twice	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
5	O
months	O
after	O
purchasing	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
back	O

I	O
hate	O
it	O

Mac	O
also	O
has	O
many	O
apps	O
and	O
programs	B-ASP
that	O
are	O
quite	O
cheap	O
or	O
free	O
.	O

The	O
difference	O
is	O
phenomenal	O

But	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
potentially	O
hundreds	O
or	O
thousands	O
in	O
the	O
near	O

.	O

I	O
was	O
getting	O
extrememly	O
frustrated	O
when	O
I	O
would	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
these	O
simple	O
taks	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
and	O
wait	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
things	B-ASP
to	O
download	O
or	O
virus	O
that	O
would	O
clog	O
up	O
my	O
PC	B-ASP

the	O
mouse	B-ASP
buttons	O
are	O
hard	O
to	O

I	O
've	O
only	O
had	O
it	O
one	O
day	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
I	O
really	O
do	O
love	O
it	O

and	O
I	O
'm	O
happy	O
it	O
was	O
economical	O

and	O
I	O
'm	O
finally	O
able	O
to	O
own	O
a	O
Mac	O

Just	O
bit	O
the	O
bullet	O
and	O
bought	O
the	O
Mac	O
hoping	O
it	O
will	O
last	O
a	O
lot	O
longer	O
…	O

I	O
recommend	O
the	O

if	O
you	O
want	O
the	O
best	O

the	O

5hrs	O

use	B-ASP
it	O

In	O

I	O
often	O

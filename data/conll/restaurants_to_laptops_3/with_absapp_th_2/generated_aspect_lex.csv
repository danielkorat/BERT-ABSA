processor,,,,"My only disappointment with the 13"" model is that they're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 <span class=""AS"">processor</span> and dual graphics cards, however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life (of about 2 more hours).","And the fact that it comes with an i5 <span class=""AS"">processor</span> definitely speeds things up","super fast <span class=""AS"">processor</span> and really nice graphics card..","The <span class=""AS"">processor</span> went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.","It has a .1 ghz faster <span class=""AS"">processor</span> and a stock","It has a faster <span class=""AS"">processor</span> and more ram.","Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word <span class=""AS"">processor</span> (such as works for windows), but iwork is cheap compared to office.","The <span class=""AS"">processor</span> screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.","The <span class=""AS"">processor</span> a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.","The AMD Turin <span class=""AS"">processor</span> seems to always perform so much better than Intel.","the i3 <span class=""AS"">processor</span> doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.","And printing from either word <span class=""AS"">processor</span> is an adventure."

tech support,,,,"I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for <span class=""AS"">tech support</span> and had to result the their online chat.","Called <span class=""AS"">tech support</span> and got the usual Acer","I understand I should call Apple <span class=""AS"">Tech Support</span> about any variables(which is my purpose of writing this con) as variables could be a bigger future problem.","I agree with the previous comment that ASUS <span class=""AS"">TECH SUPPORT</span> IS HORRIBLE","But the biggest pain is that <span class=""AS"">tech support</span> is not available 24/7.","It took Toshiba <span class=""AS"">tech support</span> 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem."
payment,,,,"The graphics were awful and the warranty isn't even worth the cheap <span class=""AS"">payment</span> on the computer."
address,,,,"-Apparently, contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good <span class=""AS"">address</span> to send complaints.","The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the <span class=""AS"">address</span> book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.","I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to <span class=""AS"">address</span> that issue.","The repairs were made quickly though I must say, however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect <span class=""AS"">address</span> and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me."
solution,,,,"If that is the case for you, I would suggest a pull-behind <span class=""AS"">solution</span> when looking at cases.","Take the simple, easy <span class=""AS"">solution</span> to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around.","The only <span class=""AS"">solution</span> is to turn the brightness down, etc."
value,,,,"It's super fast and a great <span class=""AS"">value</span> for the price!","The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good <span class=""AS"">value</span> if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.","It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any <span class=""AS"">value</span> for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.","Waiting for the i7 was well worth it, great <span class=""AS"">value</span> for the price.","This is a great <span class=""AS"">value</span> for the money.","While most people say that PCs hold functionality and <span class=""AS"">value</span> and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs."
size computer,,,,"I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect <span class=""AS"">size computer</span> if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room."
speaking,,,,"I get a ton of compliments on its size, and <span class=""AS"">speaking</span> as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.","Breaking within 1 year of purchase and <span class=""AS"">speaking</span> to 4+ people to report the damaged part will be returned late!","I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english <span class=""AS"">speaking</span> (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.","So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of <span class=""AS"">speaking</span> with a bunch of people you cant understand."
reason,,,,"The <span class=""AS"">reason</span> why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing.","It was just one problem after another for me, and that's <span class=""AS"">reason</span> we had forked out so much money was so we wouldn't have anything to worry about.","They break down just as often as PCs do, and the only <span class=""AS"">reason</span> they don't get viruses, is because no one makes viruses for them, they're not better in any way, they are worse, try finding virus protection programs for a Mac, they don't exist.","This is what they told me: It heats up, and that is the <span class=""AS"">reason</span> we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables.","But, like I said before, the only <span class=""AS"">reason</span> I don't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey.","I needed a new computer for graduate school (had never owned a laptop before), and the only <span class=""AS"">reason</span> I didn't purchase a Mac was because my school's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs.","My main <span class=""AS"">reason</span> to convert was the imovie program.","The #1 <span class=""AS"">reason</span> that is always repeated.","Windows also shuts the computer down for no <span class=""AS"">reason</span> without warning.","This is another <span class=""AS"">reason</span> to like the Mac.","As I soon discovered, though, there is a <span class=""AS"">reason</span> for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more: they use higher-quality components that are faster, better-configured, and end up lasting a lot longer."
advances,advance,,,"This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological <span class=""AS"">advances</span> associated with it.","The great 18 month same as cash financing and <span class=""AS"">Advance</span> Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills ."
operating system,,,,"The new <span class=""AS"">operating system</span> makes this computer into a super iPad.","The <span class=""AS"">operating system</span> and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.","I would like to use a different <span class=""AS"">operating system</span> altogether.","From the speed to the multi touch gestures this <span class=""AS"">operating system</span> beats Windows easily."
activity,,,,"Additionally, there is barely a ventilation system in the computer, and even the simple <span class=""AS"">activity</span> of watching videos let alone playing steam games"
shipment,,,,"Seems like maybe a bad <span class=""AS"">shipment</span> from Toshiba.","Thanks for the fast <span class=""AS"">shipment</span> and great price."

appleworks,,,,"The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of <span class=""AS"">Appleworks</span> which can render the browser useless."
conversations,conversation,,,"Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal <span class=""AS"">conversations</span> with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world."
configuration,,,,"Since I keyboard over 100 wpm, I look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard (no keys sticking or lagging, strange <span class=""AS"">configuration</span> of ""extra key"", etc."
syncing,,,,"Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless <span class=""AS"">syncing</span> - used to take me forever - now it's a snap."
boy,,,,"You can do it all on this bad <span class=""AS"">boy</span> but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy","o <span class=""AS"">boy</span> does it ever.","I wanted it for it's mobility and man, this little bad <span class=""AS"">boy</span> is very nice."
life battery,,,,"The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended <span class=""AS"">life battery</span> went out we were SOL there to, so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased."

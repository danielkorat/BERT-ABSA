Unfortunately, the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again, I have to say i hated it.
Couldn't have asked for more!
  Problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school.
With a MAC computer I have more free time as I don't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows.
I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price.
See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it.
It came in brand new and works perfectly.
It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home.
One year of trying to fix the computer by myself, with help of friends, and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it.
BUT there's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.
I finally pulled the trigger and I am blown away by how much more I enjoy my computer tasks using the Mac Mini!!!
I took it home and within 30 min, it was freezing up and did the "blue screen of death".
Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs, but he thinks it is worth every penny.
Thank you for your great product!
A scratch on a $1,500 MacBook is unforgivable.
Like the price and operation.
4gb of ram...
There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.
Very fast and efficient!
I bought my Acer Aspire custom made in June 2008.
I have a lapdesk which I can use, but I can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic.
So glad I did not waste money on a less than par product.
I was given a Mac as a birthday present and couldn't be happier with it 3 years later.
The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it.
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it's speed.
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure.
It is the best laptop ever!!!
Let me tell you, this machine is great.
Anyway, in early July of this year, the DVD burner stopped working, and the computer stared having issues with power supply.
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.
but it  has a major design flaw.
Finally, I purchased a Toshiba.
  Acer won't replace the laptop.
I couldn't be more pleased.
When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing.
Before, I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer's site.
While lacking some of the functions of the other versions, this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer.
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.
The battery life is excellent, the display is excellent, and downloading apps is a  breeze.
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.
It is so much easier to use
Winters is on it's way and I imagine it will be cozy.
But then, something goes wrong.
I just plug this into my 22" Monitor and the speedy MacOSX performs just as well on this dual-core that my Dell did with Windows 7 with a quad-core.
Dell's customer disservice is an insult to it's customers who pay good money for shoddy products.
Basic computer.
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.
After fumbling around with the OS I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue.
Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance (2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz).
The difference is it's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now, still learning the Apple navigation, but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps.
I especially like the backlit keyboard.
At first, the computer seemed a great deal--seemingly high-end specs for a low, low price.
With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must.
But, I would recommend this product.
Toshiba is a great brand, even though I haven't had it for a long time, I am very happy with it!
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.
Whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows (or Winblows, as I like ot call it).
I love it!
  The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.
Just for a stupid CD.
I was so excited to receive the Toshiba L455 as a gift/bonus for some work I had done for a friend of mine!
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key.
i can use it for all of my needs.
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is.
Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems, as well.
  They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months!
We used PC products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing.
It was secure and easy to navigate.
PLEASE MAKE THESE!
Also, because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer, some websites wouldn't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems.
  Also, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco, returned it in santa maria, thinking it was just a problem with that computer.
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.
Moral of the story:-Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers.
They say it could be the motherboard again, but Dell
I will not buy another one.
Even set at the highest level, the computer sacrifices its  queen every time.
Be safe buy a Sony.
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.
Being only 2 months old, I am not a happy camper!
Web surfuring is smooth and seamless.
I already have a HP laptop I bought last year that's standard size.
I think this computer is super lame.
We did not even have it a year.
2 months later, the battery went.
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive, my mac is just flying.
I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.
Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.
Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars!
I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait.
The computer is a dream come true.
I will never go back to Windows!
ive never had a problem with it!
NOT WITH APPLE.
It's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I'm struggle with finding the correct keys (but that was expected).
NO good.
I saw this one, and I have the most difficult time trying to use them, they've made great dust collectors, I hate putting this computer down
The computer blinks it shuts off at will.
The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.
Again, the same problem, the right speaker did not work.
No viruses.
Keyboard is great, very quiet for all the typing that I do.
Do you ever think HP would do that? NEVER!
This mac does come with an extender cable and I'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac.
I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.
I had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .
This was absolutely annoying!
MY TRACKPAD IS NOT WORKING.
I am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents I have received to date.
My wife was so excited to open the box, but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should.
12.44 seconds to boot.
It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.
It was definelty a smart move.
The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room.
I bought it to use in college and it is perfect.
I do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.
I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused.
You will regret it if you buy any dell.
With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down.
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.
I  asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches, dents  or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of  damage could happen.
This is the third MacBook Pro in our family.
Either way the entire thing was just a joke, a complete rip off!
  Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer.
Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell.
We'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again!
Looking online, many people are having the same problem.
Got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college.
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.
Yes, he is a self professed "Mac snob.
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming, otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks.
Recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me.
I hope this review helps.
I don't really have a complaint.
  After 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.
Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.
Heck, if I had enough ' money, I would but it as a gift for someone.
To my mind much more usable than the toy called an IPad.
When it broke I wanted another Acer and chose the V5.
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it.
The feature are good enough for what I need.
I was originally concerned that I couldn't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting, but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs.
I love the size, keyboard, the functions.
My kids have to take their PCs in once a year to have them "de-bugged".
 I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!
Now they are believers in the product.
The first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it.
That being said, it still runs video in full screen decently.
I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it, however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however, due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink.
I love the operating system and the preloaded software.
Also, in using the built-in camera, my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the "Star Wars" saga.
The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc!
I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!
I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident (long story).
Registration/1st use is easy.
Also is portable and reliable.
The graphics are great.
Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said "buy a MAC".
Exactly as posted plus a great value.
Thank you Best Buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were GREAT too!
I have other computers that get strong signals that don't drop in places that this "net"book loses its signal.
I guess he was the technical person.
After 3 pleasant weeks of use, the laptop just died.
Most of them were either too big, too noisy and too slow after 2 years.
About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro, which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro.
  However the frozen screens kept happening.
For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop.
I let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease.
I also own an HP notebook and it doesn't even come close.
High price tag, however.
Well designed and fast.
I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation.
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.
Save your money and go for a better device.
They transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can't understand what they are saying.
Didn't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make/model).
Probbly the worst decision we ever made!
I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market.
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare.
was debating to buy one for months, checked out different stuff on youtube, and read different articles and debates,I just didnt really wanna spend the money but Im glad that I did.
Just a month and a half or two months ago, my VAIO crashed again.
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook.
I'll wait and save up for a new one.
But with A WAY Bigger Screen, and IS able to connect to an HDMI.
I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer.
My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!
great price free shipping what else can i ask for!!
I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one.
On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969.
I spent 2200 dollars on a "top of the line laptop".
If you want a little more custom ability, drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more.
Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen, its a great computer.
Small and light weight.
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well, battery life AMAZING.
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
and the speakers is the worst ever.
If it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a Friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step.
But if you're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc.
Dell sucks
-Complied to their protocol, called number, made "case", got an email address to send complaint.
When considering a Mac, look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag.
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse.
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.
Will certainly use MacConnection again.
Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel, sound quality, etc.
Startup times are incredibly long: over two minutes.
I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.
Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air.
For this purpose, it's great.
Keyboard responds well to presses.
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won't have to worry about a crash.
Good computer and fast.
they had to replace the motherboard in April
More relieved than anything.
It's light and easy to transport.
I would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer!
I can't even turn it off.
He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it.
Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming, as I have a desktop rig for that reason.
Delivery was early too.
the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.
Now I could get myself a cheap computer, that will probably work a whole lot better!
I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one, but IMO NO STARS
You better believe my next computer will be a MAC!
I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office.
I worked in IT retail sales before.
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it...
pros:  the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so.
I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails.
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro!
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers.
It is a REAL touchpad, not the toy I saw in other brands.
The image is great, and the soud is excelent.
The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it.
It works great and I am so happy I bought it.
Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the "human interface.
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used.
The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center.
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it.
Battery life needs more life.
They say sorry out of warranty.
it was a tough choice.
Its worth every Penny.
We decided we would try to trade-in our old ones.
Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought.
I'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer.
I can't even remember how I finally got it taken care of, but I was done with Sony after that!
Nice packing.
  After that the said it was under warranty.
That system is fixed.
I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price, and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls.
I can't say enough good for it!
not something you want to miss out on!!!
The Notebook PC,Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me.
Well, they don't care a bunch.
It's software and speed enable it to do amazing things.
It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer!
-Called headquarters again, they report that TFT panel is broken, should be fixed by the end of the week (week 3).
I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life.
This computer was awful!
  I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.
But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors.
I have found also, it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access;
There are so many things wrong with this product, it just makes me want to set my self on fire!
The fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine.
The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop.
Call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us.
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.
COMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS.
It was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again.
I was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates.
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst.
I started hainv problems with it within the first month.
Its perfect, not much heavy.
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i've had it.
Posted Nov 8, 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook.
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.
If that is the case, then I am completely happy
We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $350 more than my original Mac.
I fell in love with my machine, and it was pampered.
Which is what I did, check out my ACER 5517!
The price is higher than most lab top out there; however, he/she will get what they paid for, which is a great computer.
No luck, although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls (difficult to believe).
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM.
The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google "dell coupons" you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price.
I haven't used it for anything high tech yet, but I love it already.
This is definitely a computer worth the money;
Every time I log into the system after a few hours, there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through.
I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all.
do not buy you will be disappointed.
So it was only about 2 weeks ago.
OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable.
So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
I wanted to spend around $700 to $800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop.
I had static in the output, and I had to reduce the sound output quality to "FM" as opposed to the default "CD.
I will be patient for few months.
The only time I have restarted is during system updates.
Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.
-They reported that the computer is in their headquarters.
Better stick with another brand.
Awesome graphics!
I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little, while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it.
No tutorials on the display.
It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it.
First things first, Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier, unlike the windows computers.
HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP, I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS.
I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes.
Oh my goodness-I am not a happy camper.
The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!
It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.
Though please note that sometimes it crashes, and the sound quality isnt superb.
It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb.
Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems.
I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program, and the program will simply open that file.
The SuperDrive is quiet.
Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site.
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: " Consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.
It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems.
(No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.
I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.
My ONLY issues are: 1) the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
The only thing I miss are the "Home/End" type keys and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long.
The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past.
There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.
The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions!
The screen takes some getting use to, because it is smaller than the laptop.
I wouldn't play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I'd highly recommend checking this out.
I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader (software) would not load.
Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up!
The configuration is perfect for my needs.
It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it.
  Sony, Acer, Dell, Packard Bell and Toshiba.
A cheaper price should not equal a "cheap" product.
I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop!
Just a black screen!
I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked.
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.
-No backlit keyboard, but not an issue for me.
I've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly.
only good thing is the graphics quality.
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands.
The specs are pretty good too.
I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.
They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.
The book is useless.
Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall? Yeah, I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire.
The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing.
The only thing that I have, is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters, would help if it was a little lighter then it is.
Looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level, I decided to purchase the MBP 15in Intel Core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop.
I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday.
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5.
I bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design.
But we had paid for bluetooth, and there was none.
You may need to special order a bag.
I eventually did the migration from my iMac backup disc which uses USB.
Still trying to learn how to use it.
Have returned that laptop unused.
Sorry, newegg.
I expected so as it's an Apple product, but I was glad to see my expectations exceeded, this is THE laptop to buy right now.
also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.
I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased.
I have nothing to regret from this new product.
This worked just fine.
There were small problems with Mac office.
I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am.
Ever since I bought this laptop, so far I've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.
The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue.
  The computer is so slow, even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.
It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it.
Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications (ie Internet tabs, programs, etc) simultaneously.
I've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems.
It is extremely user friendly and intuitive.
  This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
(The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive.)
It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time.
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it.
The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more.
This computer gets very hot, before shutting down.
I use my friends and family's $2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP, well, I'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone!
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this "never" happen...
The power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but won't stay connected.
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8
I called apple and no solution.
I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27" Imacs.
Only issue is that it is a little slow, and I'm fixing that by adding more RAM.
They don t translate from a Mac, even on Word, resulting in a ton of run-on sentences.
All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.
I like the lighted screen at night.
He has replaced his hard drive twice and (of course) has had to pay for antivirus software every year.
I do not recommend this company or their products!!!!
on the bright side at least I wasn't without my laptop for long this time!
While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down, this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I've used.
I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well!
I love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it.
Pay attention to the specs if you want these options.
It really is very light compared to other computers.
Comes with iMovie;
It's catatonic.
Apple hit a home run here.
That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.
And windows 7 works like a charm.
The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.
I really like the Mac 15.4in. Notebook, but its very pricey.
I'm honestly afraid that it will burn me, it's that hot!
I can't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print.
They definitely have a superior product!
Have used only Macs for years.
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow.
I'm going to buy a logitevh c270.
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key.
I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.
By week two, my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much.
Since I never really got to use this, I can't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them.
I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.
It works great for general internet use, Microsoft Office apps, home bookkeeping, etc.
I claim that this has no value to me, the laptop was new anyway.
  luckly i had a student task force able to help, or else it would have crashed within the first year.
As a user of a PC, I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself "Getting the job done quicker.
This is my second laptop,and it is head and shoulders above my first.
for 2 months.
They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with.
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.
I want the portability of a tablet, without the limitations of a tablet and that's where this laptop comes into play.
I love the quick start up.
Memory is upgradable.
I saved about $100 plus tax ordering on Amazon and since I have prime, it arrived overnight for just $3.99 more.
Also, HDD secures inside using rails, and there is only one set on the main hard drive.
I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90's.
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.
I am so happy to have purchased this computer.
1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
Speakers too small to be of any real use.
Again, decent comp for the price, and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me.
I called back to ensure that received it, they had.
I bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.
tons of bloatware and junk programs.
I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since.
Ive had to call tech support many times.
Great product.
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.
But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.
One of the wonderful things about Macs is that they are virus free.
In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced.
So far, it's an average laptop - no better, no worse than the HP I replaced.
It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off.
However, it did not have any scratches, ZERO battery cycle count (pretty surprised), and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly.
OSX Mountain Lion  soon to upgrade to Mavericks.
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice.
I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE.
I'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100% that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence.
So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15" Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon!
I had to pay for the shipping!
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7.
Stop living in the stone age and buy a mac, you will not be sorry at all!!
Guess I'll stay away from HP.
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices, and USB devices are recognized almost instantly.
I am constantly trying to uninstall programs, clean cookies, and delete unused files.
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.
I have never had an experience like this.
-Touchpad will take a bit of time to get used to.
This is what I call a good after sales service.
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8.
Right out of the box, this little netbook did everything I asked of it, including streaming the everyday video you're bound to encounter checking mail and websites (my biggest complaint previously).
His was worth $36.
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.
It suddenly can not work.
Sent unit back and it's been two months.
Wireless has not been a issue for me, like some others have meantioned.
-Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam.
After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs.
I 'have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes I have had an issue with it one month out of warranty.
Now, I guess, I'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor, hapless soul.
I like coming back to Mac OS but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $400  old HP laptop.
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.
Screen is crystal clear, yes it's small - but it's a netbook!
The system it comes with does not work properly, so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all.
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.
Then the hard drive failed;
The battery has never worked well.
I've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it!
Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached.
I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop.
Even though it is running Snow Leopard, 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel.
They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.
Consumer Report recommended Toshiba.
There is no "tools" menu.
I went right out and purchased another laptop.
I ordered four D620 laptops.
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price, but totally worth it for a good piece of mind.
it has 3 usb ports, 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion.
The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person, I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly.
I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating.
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned.
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.
The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.
The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer  usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite.
Mac tutorials do help.
I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need.
I used windows XP, windows Vista, and Windows 7 extensively.
So far, so good!
I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling.
The MAC Mini, wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done.
When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP, yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.
This is the first laptop I've owned, althougth I used several at my previous job.
I love this computer.
There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
The keyboard, which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard, now looks terrible.
They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.
I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner.
I can't begin to say how disappointed I am.
My wife also has problems with her Asus - different model.
From the get-go, the M6809 was unsteady in its operation;
I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back, but the return calls never came.
!so nice .. stable .. fast .. now i got my SSD !
Great laptop that offers many great features!
That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software, the speakers and the subwoofer I got (that WAS worth the money), the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer, the extended life battery and the Docking port.
My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete.
After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses, a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route.
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose.
With notes saying they replaced the hard drive.
There are no gold key numbers too intall programs, you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time.
I just hope this expensive laptop doesn't go dead like my friends...it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust.
I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try.
I got a mac as my HS graduation gift.
I have three words: Piece of Junk!
I will upgrade the ram myself (because with this model you can you can do it) later on.
Such as PAGES, NUMBERS, and so on.
It is not ideal for children because of the temp.
  So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped.
Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode.
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage.
I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it.
I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it won't even be dead.
The bottom-line is that this laptop just isn't worth it.
  They replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board.
I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.
Vista is a nightmare.
I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase!
You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick.
But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it.
It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.
I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....
I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac.
Love the speed, especially!
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been.
It's annoying very much and I won't ever buy any Acer products.
I babyed the heck out of it and i still do.
The quality, engineering design and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop.
I am very satisfied with the mini.
I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection.
I love the multi-touch trackpad.
The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me.
Not to mention, the battery life is absolutely amazing.
I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio.
So you might ask, what did Apple do for me?
After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer.
I wanted a computer that was quite, fast, and that had overall great performance.
I had read online that some users were having sound problems.
I chose the iBookG4, a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
not the day received.
*4 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam, decided to send complaint email to Apple.
compresses itself and you can't use it.
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13.3 MacBook Pro  Model # MD101LL/A.
just chill and enjoy.
Next, most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop.
Also, it hardly ever crashes.
I am a freelance graphic artist.
Buy the separate RAM memory and you will have a rocket!
It took so much time.
May be better for the occasional web surfer.
Price was higher when purchased on MAC when compared to price showing on PC when I bought this product.
Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.
  It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.
Definitely worth spending the money on it.
Graphics are clean and sharp, internet interfaces are seamless.
It feels cheap, the keyboard is not very sensitive.
The Dell Inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard, which I miss on my Apple laptops.
I'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfect..i It is!!
It out performs any other laptop on the market today.
Set up was easy.
Design: very durable.
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors.
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me, I only had a problem once or twice with it, But probably my computer was a bit defective.
I sit down and use my husband's work PC and I don't like it one bit.
This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone.
Soft touch, anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws.
He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started.
This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases.
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.
If someone called me an Apple Fanboy...it would make sense.
It's face and depanable.
  I have used a couple of others on the job as well.
I took it back for a full refund.
They're not safe, they're not durable, they just a worthless.
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.
I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years.
This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone.
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.
It was so exciting for me to unwrapp my new mac.
Only thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive.
Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk.
It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.
Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on.
I'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible.
  i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months.
I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.
I love everything about this computer.
WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER--------LOU
I have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam, just for starters.
The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.
MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life, as well as the many background programs that run without the user's knowlede.
I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.
This laptop serves all my needs.
I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great!
Couldn't keep a page up you were working on!
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer.
For the same price, you get a lot more in the Asus....1920x1080 res.
The feel of this is better than the Toshiba, too.
I had of course bought a 3 year warranty, so I sent it in to be replaced and (almost 2 months later) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement.
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint.
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!
Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily.
I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP, but I use the touchpad 90% of the time.
It runs perfectly.
Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort, I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand.
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip.
Other Thoughts: Do not purchase this product.
No installation disk (DVD) is included.
The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.
The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard.
Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent.
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is, I never expected to have an application crash within the first month, but I did.
NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS.
If you need an affordable, entry-level laptop, this will fit the bill.
And this isn't just my one experine.
I use it mostly for content creation (Audio, video, photo editing) and its reliable.
Which it did not have, only 3 USB 2 ports.
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.
In short I would never buy a Compaq again.
That includes transferring my music and movies.
Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed.
My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates.
Newegg's RMA service was great as always, I contacted them late Friday night, and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday.
It can't get any better.
It's a lottery at this point as I have read that other have received new ones with the same problem.
But not in this case.
(I had been a Windows/Linux user before this) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.
Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.
It quit working within a weeks time.
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.
The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
It doesn't heat up like my old laptop.
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did.
My computer froze on several occasion, had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all.
I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in (battle of the Smithsonian) After on Hour mine was at 53% life left and his was at 69% life left.
With no problems,  I'm happy with this purchase because I saved money compared to buying it anywhere else.
Features like the font are very block-like and old school.
The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.
It doesnt get hot like my PC, with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it.
First, you ll discover that the word processing program known as  Appleworks  rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer, if it translates at all.
got another 1, and same issue.
For me, five stars is not enough.
Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me.
I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it.
i cant believe HP put this out.
  I should have realized that trouble was brewing .
(You may be reading one now!
  However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything.
Another issue I have with it is the battery.
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.
Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch.
The Macbook Pro is the premier choice for college students.
Three, the mac book has advantages over pcs' with linux based os there is very 'few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac.
The program came with the computer and works beautifully.
We were occasional Mac users before, but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford.
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro, this thing holds its own.
While many people brag about Mac being "intuitive", it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a PC, but once I got the hang of it, I don't want to go back.
Files as well would become lost, deleted or corrupted.
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer.
company provides UPS shipping, fast, great!
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so.
This was an update from an early MacBook Pro.
It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.
It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.
Was very much worth the price i paid.
I enjoy very much my new Toshiba, purchased specifially for attending online schooling.
With the macbook pro it comes with freesecuritysoftware to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails.
I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
I was starting to boil.
The PhotoBooth is a great program, it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera.
People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling.
It did everything we expected!
Im glad that it has such great features in it.
It's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc!
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.
Also, macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!
The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD'd during that time!
Amazing Quality!
Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it.
Mine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!).
Those things are very important - vital even!
1) Payed $2200 for a "premium" laptop
My Toshiba did not have sound on everything, just certain things.
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs.
  Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside.
Runs Hot  I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product.
WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO!
Chatting with Acer support, I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files.
iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.
Strengths:Well-shaped Weaknesses:A bad videocard!
It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.
Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without.
We love the size of the screen, although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around.
After looking at all the pros and cons, I decided on the Macbook Pro.
But I was completely wrong, this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use.
Very small and portable I've had this netbook about 12 hrs now and It's better than expected.
it has had some problems.
I also purchased Office Max's "Max Assurance" with the "no lemon" clause.
They're easy, fun, powerful and will last a long time.
WHEN TYPING, LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES.
Get this instead, you won't be sorry.
While I mostly use it for email, internet and gaming, I'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I've come to appreciate from Mac laptops.
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful, well worth it.
was a great deal i will give that.
I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).
It is so speedy.
This is a review of windows vista system.
It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me.
We are addicted to the Mac.
I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college.
  It is easy to use, fast and has great graphics for the money.
  Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.
It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access.
The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.
The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!
You won't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.
Games being the main issue.
But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
It still serves me well both in business and home needs.
The pictures are clear as can be.
The games included are very good games.
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer.
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid.
I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro.
However, this will be my last as well.
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.
I never tried any external mics with that iMac.
They were able to set-up with labtops themselves within a few minutes.
Hieroglyphics are quite common.
No Viruses!
working with Mac is so much easier, so many cool features.
It easily fits into most computer bags but doesn't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks.
It was returned on the third day I owned it.
In November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after intalling a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.
My laptop now has no battery.
I fell in love with it.
Otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations.
Am very glad I bought it, great netbook, low price.
The touch pad is among the best.
This was the same problem with my MacBook (circa 2007) that I just retired.
I was psyched.
It s heavy for Mac book but is good.
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...
The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it.
I am definitely sold, and not going back to PCs for home use!
Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.
Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there's nothing like a Mac.
  The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.
Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out.
I finally decided on this one and couldn't be any happier.
So in late March, early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had.
Bottom line, I doubt you'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine.
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing, but very easy to use.
and if u did.
Its pretty much fire it up and go.
breaks easily.
Bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since "learning how to use it".
First the screen goes completely out.
I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!
Apple "Help" is a mixed bag.
I was amazed at how fast the delivery was.
-got it back 3 months later
  It is just slow slow slow.
I have been a mac user since the mid 90s.
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
Before I got my macbook, I owned a Dell laptop.
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.
2.The wireless card is low quality.
This laptop looks great on the surface: 17" inch screen, good  price-point, nice appearance, boots up quickly, runs fast etc.
4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...
It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz.
I'm glad I bought this laptop, it was worth the few ($100) extra dollars.
Some days it's just blurry, some days it appears that it's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains.
I grew up in a design family so it only made sense.
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years, I decided to buy MacBook Pro.
i had to return it for a replacement.
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation, but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size.
I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I can't imagine ever going back.
Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.
  I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters.
It's applications are terrific, including the replacements for Microsoft office.
Made interneting (part of my business) very difficult to maintain.
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria.
Does everything I need it to, has a wonderful battery life and I couldn't be happier.
I really don't like it, but I am stuck.
The settings are not user-friendly either.
Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook, I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros.
  the battery is irreplaceable.
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping.
WiFi capability, disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required.
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.
Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small, portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so.
So, I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try.
But reasons we chose this Apple computer.
My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift, and i'm totally (almost kind of maybe definitely) obsessed with it.
It wasn't worth it.
  I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
I love the way the entire suite of software works together.
I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME!
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.
It cannot save the correct date and time I set.
Dismantle the whole thing? Then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before.
I have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months!
Yes, the MBP is more expensive than competing PC laptops.
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install, but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu.
After all was said and done, I essentially used that $450 savings to buy 16GB of RAM, TWO Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives and an OWC upgrade kit to install the second hard drive.
I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed.
I saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what I know now,I would not buy it at that price.
Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
It is quiet and a real joy to watch work.
I would like at least a 4 hr. battery life.
  Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one, so back it went to get the correct drive.
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back.
 Went silently.
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!
So I called, AGAIN.
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in.
This a starter notebook.
Very happy.
Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac!
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's "like new," I might have 8 months next time.
In the three years I've had my MacBook Pro, I have never had a virus on my computer, and I do a lot of work on the internet.
It turned out it's not really a problem to have a Mac.
Clearly, there is something wrong with the product and LG didn't take up the responsibility.
I will only buy apple laptops from now on.
One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables.
I'm tired of the inept service.
I believe I purchased this in Dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day, 4-6 days a week.
Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it.
We now own two of these, identical.
big mistake!
After they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.
So far, a great product.
  They removed them and returned the computer to me.
I have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.
Cons: Screen resolution.
Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.
It is very slim, the track pad is very much impressed with me.
I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!
the hardware problems have been so bad, i can't wait till it completely dies in 3 years, TOPS!
I can't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket.
The screen is huge and coloful, but no LED backlighting.
  Now, as easy as it is to use, and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop.
Plus stylish.
I have been a PC user since middle school, but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side, or should I say the brighter side of life.
Even out of warranty!
It is very well built.
They are not.
Garageband is more for the musicians, and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone, good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level.
  I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents.
I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing.
Very fast boot up and shut down.
Nothing about it that i don't love, apple always makes a great product.
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset.
  Another two weeks later and it was back in my possession.
Excellent LED monitor and well equipped.
The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.
Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.
  I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.
At first it's like you're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop.
I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba!
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment.
It's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk.
  I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
I'm pretty sure it's not newegg's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop.
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.
It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier.
This is my second MacBook.
If a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.
This is not Best Buy's fault.
wonderful features.
Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine.
Just be careful; you always have to give up some good stuff for others.
You just cannot beat the functionality of an Apple device.
I now travel with this laptop and my work PC.
My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday.
I practically have a new laptop with all the "fixes" they have done!
Apple is living up to its name with the mini and, for our needs, it's perfect.
I have the A65 - right now it's a paperweight.
Fine if you have a touch screen.
It's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it.
Its a good laptop for its value.
Everything about this computer is easy to use.
I'm very happy with this machine!
It's a great product for a great price!
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement.
Setting would change for some reason, the screen size would change on it's own, like the pixel sizes and whatnot.
its sad because their commercials are great.
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer.
Premium price for the OS more than anything else.
I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times.
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good, working well so far.
I dislike the weight and size, cubersome.
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.
I've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates.
It's great to have a solid Mac in the living room.
I have an iPhone, and iPad, so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the Mini.
The screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.
Needless to say, not to happy with the product.
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys.
I will also say it is much better than I expected!
Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.
(Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is.
I'm now trying to decide on another Dell model.
Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it.
So, I went back.
I hate it.
Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free.
The difference is phenomenal.
But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future.
I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC.
the mouse buttons are hard to push.
I've only had it one day, but I really do love it and I'm happy it was economical and I'm finally able to own a Mac!
Just bit the bullet and bought the Mac hoping it will last a lot longer….
I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market.
The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it.
In my line of work, I often have to take work home, and this makes it so easy.
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks.
Took the netbook on a vacation trip and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop.
The screen graphics and clarity, and sharpness are great.
The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to, but overall it's worth it!
In my opinion it was not as user friendly as I expected either.
  Worse, for the price I could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine.
So noise is reduced at least 50% and the heat is much better, now it doesn't feel hot but warm.

We	O
went	O
to	O
celebrate	O
two	O
birthdays	O
and	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
special	O
and	O
different	O
.	O

Our	O
visit	O
their	O
to	O
say	O
the	O

,	O
was	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
and	O
costly	O
experience	O
!	O

And	O
even	O
more	O
so	O
unpleasant	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
costly	O
for	O
such	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
experience	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
arrive	O
late	O
for	O
our	O
reservation	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
complain	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
wait	B-ASP
for	O
a	O
table	O
.	O

Although	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
10-15	O
minutes	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
45	O
minutes	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
ushered	O
to	O
the	O
bar	O
to	O
wait	O
momentarily	O
and	O
upon	O
arrival	O
were	O
so	O
excited	O
.	O

The	O
place	B-ASP
is	O
beautiful	O
!	O

The	O
hostess	B-ASP
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
$	O
14	O
drinks	B-ASP
were	O
were	O
horrible	O
!	O

Once	O
we	O
finally	O
got	O
a	O
table	O
,	O
despite	O
indicating	O
we	O
wanted	O
an	O
alla	O
carte	O
menu	O
we	O
were	O
pushed	O
into	O
a	O
table	O
that	O
was	O
only	O
price	O
fixed	O
!	O

Since	O
we	O
were	O
already	O
waiting	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
we	O
felt	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
choice	O
but	O
to	O
accept	O
it	O
.	O

Our	O
experience	O
did	O
not	O
ever	O
get	O
any	O
better	O
.	O

For	O
each	O
course	O
we	O
waited	O
over	O
1/2	O
hour	O
to	O
45	O
minutes	O
and	O
were	O
never	O
offered	O
a	O
drink	O
.	O

We	O
also	O
asked	O
for	O
Hooka	O
six	O
times	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-ASP
kept	O
telling	O
us	O
one	O
minute	O
and	O
never	O
returning	O
with	O
the	O
Hooka	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
4th	O
time	O
i	O
asked	O
again	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-ASP
than	O
said	O
after	O
our	O
dinner	O
.	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O
beverages	O
and	O
never	O
received	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O
sides	O
which	O
the	O
waiter	B-ASP
than	O
admitted	O
that	O
he	O
forgot	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
order	O

My	O
chicken	B-ASP
was	O
inedible	O
as	O
there	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
fatty	O
lumps	O
which	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
keep	O
spitting	O
out	O

By	O

we	O
still	O
had	O
not	O

one	O

What	O
we	O
did	O
do	O
was	O
waste	O
3	O
hours	O
being	O
trapped	O
in	O
a	O

By	O

were	O

to	O

went	O
here	O
for	O
a	O

Five	O
of	O
us	O
walked	O
in	O
at	O
approximately	O
6:20	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O
evening	O

The	O

said	O
"	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
taken	O
aback	O
,	O
as	O
this	O
seemed	O
to	O
present	O
a	O
problem	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
restaurant	O
looked	O
fairly	O
empty	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
hastily	O
put	O
the	O
table	O
together	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
menu	B-ASP
is	O
fairly	O
simple	O
without	O
much	O
descriptions	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
tap	O
beer	B-ASP
that	O
evening	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
disappointment	O
.	O

Not	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
selection	B-ASP
of	I-ASP
bottled	I-ASP
beer	I-ASP
either	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
with	O
Brahma	O

The	O
appetizers	O
we	O
ordered	O
were	O
served	O
quickly	O
-	O
an	O
order	O
of	O
fried	B-ASP
oysters	I-ASP
and	I-ASP
clams	I-ASP
were	O
delicious	O
but	O
a	O
tiny	O
portion	O
(	O
maybe	O
3	O
of	O
each	O
)	O
.	O

The	O
lobster	B-ASP
knuckles	I-ASP
(	O
special	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
)	O
were	O
ok	O
,	O
but	O
pretty	O
tasteless	O

I	O
believe	O
there	O
were	O
2	O

After	O
we	O
ate	O
our	O
appetizers	O
(	O
which	O
took	O
all	O
of	O
8	O
minutes	O
)	O
we	O
ordered	O
another	O
round	O
of	O
Brahma	O
's	O
-	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
stall	O
a	O
little	O
as	O
we	O
waited	O
for	O
our	O
sixth	O
dinner	O
member	O

The	O
waitress	O
appeared	O
and	O
asked	O
us	O
if	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
order	O
.	O

We	O
replied	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
5	O
more	O
minutes	O
if	O
that	O
was	O
okay	O
.	O

She	O
replied	O
"	O
well	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
convenient	O
for	O
us	O
if	O
you	O
ordered	O
now	O

since	O
you	O
are	O
a	O
larger	O
party	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
might	O
get	O

We	O
called	O
the	O
other	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
close	O
by	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
told	O
us	O
to	O
order	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
did	O
.	O

The	O
food	O
arrived	O
in	O
about	O
15	O
minutes	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
Thai	B-ASP
style	I-ASP
Fried	I-ASP
Sea	I-ASP
Bass	I-ASP
...	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
good	O

Everyone	O
seemed	O
generally	O
happy	O
with	O
their	O
food	B-ASP
,	O
except	O
my	O
brother	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
grilled	B-ASP

seemingly	O
drenched	O
in	O
Grapfruit	O

I	O
heard	O
the	O
lobster	B-ASP
roll	I-ASP
was	O
excellent	O

They	O
seemed	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
rush	O
us	O
along	O
,	O
taking	O
plates	O
without	O
asking	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
done	O
(	O
my	O
sister	O
still	O
had	O
her	O
fork	O
in	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
good	O
-	O
a	O
little	O
on	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
it	O
a	O
4	O
instead	O

of	O
the	O

which	O
I	O
would	O

this	O

that	O

We	O
ordered	O

The	O
dishes	O
came	O
out	O
around	O
5	O

The	O
bibimbap	B-ASP

eat	O
his	O

the	O

that	O

At	O
this	O

the	O

comes	O
over	O

asks	O
us	O
if	O
everything	O
was	O
okay	O

I	O
was	O

so	O

that	O
I	O
was	O

anything	O

what	O
,	O
the	O

WALKED	O
away	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
switch	O
with	O
my	O

again	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
maybe	O
I	O
could	O
stomach	O
the	O
meat	O

again	O

but	O
the	O
spinach	B-ASP
was	O
so	O
undercooked	O
that	O
I	O
just	O

through	O
it	O

I	O
could	O
n't	O
even	O

I	O
've	O

I	O

it	O
was	O

on	O
a	O
Saturday	O

(	O
another	O
45mins	O

half	O

Never	O

The	O
manager	B-ASP

the	O

When	O
we	O

Ca	O

believe	O
how	O

to	O
its	O

What	O
a	O
hassle	O
!	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
outstanding	O

There	O
is	O
no	O

the	O

the	O

On	O

Mistakes	O

they	O
are	O
usually	O
accompanied	O
by	O
an	O
apology	O

perhaps	O
even	O
a	O

Without	O

I	O
would	O
probably	O
go	O
back	O

there	O
are	O
just	O
too	O
many	O

restaurants	O
in	O

Wow	O

The	O
bread	B-ASP

the	O

The	O

I	O
went	O
with	O
JWILS	O

Her	O
review	O

above	O

I	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
went	O
for	O
this	O
horrible	O
experience	O

My	O
friend	O
is	O
100	O
%	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
experience	O
we	O
had	O
.	O

The	O
hostess	B-ASP
was	O
rude	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
distinct	O
feeling	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
serve	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
my	O
friend	O
left	O
out	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
the	O
bartender	B-ASP
disappeared	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
menu	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
waitress	B-ASP
looked	O
at	O
my	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
insane	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
shocked	O
that	O
my	O
friends	O
wanted	O
to	O
stay	O
after	O
the	O
waitress	B-ASP
said	O
,	O
"	O
can	O
I	O
help	O
you	O
"	O
and	O
"	O
how	O
many	O
are	O
in	O
your	O

"	O

What	O
?	O

The	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
standing	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
her	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
indication	O
of	O
how	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
there	O
were	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
n't	O
look	O
like	O
the	O
other	O
patrons	O
in	O
there	O
so	O
unfortunately	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
problem	O

Shame	O

I	O
was	O
there	O
for	O
brunch	O
recently	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
tag	O
teamed	O
by	O
a	O
waitress	B-ASP
and	O
a	O
waiter	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
waiter	B-ASP
delivered	O
our	O
food	O
while	O
holding	O
what	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
plastic	O
bag	O
of	O
garbage	O
in	O
one	O

I	O
ca	O
n't	O
believe	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
but	O
please	O
put	O
the	O
bag	O
down	O
before	O
delivering	O
food	O

The	O
waitress	B-ASP
came	O
to	O
check	O
in	O
on	O
us	O
every	O
few	O
minutes	O

and	O
began	O
to	O
clear	O

were	O
still	O
eating	O
(	O
a	O

I	O
could	O

one	O
of	O
my	O
friends	O

who	O
was	O
in	O
mid	O
bite	O

to	O
clear	O
the	O

She	O
then	O
put	O
the	O
check	O
down	O
without	O
asking	O
if	O
we	O

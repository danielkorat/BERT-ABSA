All	O

my	O

that	O
the	O

about	O
it-especially	O
the	O
shows	B-ASP
and	O
actors	B-ASP

My	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
thougt	O
it	O
would	O

Hyde	I-ASP
Pub	I-ASP
for	O
our	O

and	O
to	O
our	O
surprise	O
it	O
was	O
fantastic	O

I	O
can	O
understand	O
the	O
prices	B-ASP
if	O
it	O
served	O
better	O
food	B-ASP
,	O
like	O
some	O
Chinese	O
restaurants	O
in	O
midtown/uptown	O
area	O

We	O
could	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
meal	O
of	O
the	O
yummy	O
dumplings	B-ASP
from	O
the	O
dumpling	O
menu	O
.	O

Be	O
prepared	O
to	O
wait	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
place	B-ASP
is	O
pretty	O
tiny	O
.	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
is	O
great	O
.	O

Any	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
reservation	B-ASP
you	O
'll	O
wait	O
for	O
max	O
5	O
minutes	O

so	O
have	O
a	O
drink	B-ASP
at	O
the	O

Go	O
hungry	O
and	O
enjoy	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
dinner	B-ASP
in	O
Manhattan	O
should	O
cost	O
$	O
400.00	O
where	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
swept	O
off	O
my	O
feet	O
.	O

I	O
like	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
dont	O
get	O
me	O
wrong	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
jsut	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-ASP
who	O
work	O
there	O
are	O
evil	O
and	O
incompetent	O
!!	O

They	O
do	O
n't	O
walk	O
around	O
with	O
the	O
trays	B-ASP
of	I-ASP
Dim	I-ASP

I	O

with	O
two	O

dishes	B-ASP
that	O
were	O
not	O

to	O
be	O
a	O

thing	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
annoying	O

they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
squeeze	O
me	O
in	O
at	O
6	O
after	O
i	O
called	O
the	O

before	O
my	O

told	O
me	O
they	O
'd	O
treat	O
us	O
well	O
for	O
the	O
occasion	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
spot	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
overpriced	O
and	O
overrated	O

But	O
the	O
coconut	B-ASP

was	O
good	O

We	O
ordered	O
the	O
chicken	B-ASP

but	O
what	O
we	O
got	O
were	O
a	O
few	O

chicken	B-ASP
,	O
all	O
dark	O

and	O
on	O

the	O

so	O
the	O

bland	O
and	O
disgusting	O

they	O
did	O
give	O
a	O
15	O

at	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
was	O
n't	O

They	O

I	O
suggest	O
only	O

what	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
place	B-ASP
is	O
so	O
Ghetto	O
its	O
not	O
even	O
funny	O
.	O

The	O
last	O
two	O
times	O
I	O
ordered	O
from	O
here	O
my	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
soo	O
spicy	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
barely	O
eat	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
spice	O
took	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
flavor	B-ASP
of	O
the	O
dish	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
staff	B-ASP
is	O
incredibly	O
helpful	O
and	O
attentive	O
.	O

This	O
place	B-ASP
is	O
the	O
most	O
Japanese	O
it	O
can	O
ever	O
get	O

The	O
banana	B-ASP
tower	I-ASP
is	O
an	O
amazing	O

Look	O
foward	O
to	O
trying	O
the	O
Ruben	O
upon	O
returning	O

We	O
were	O
walking	O
around	O
the	O
village	O
and	O
went	O
into	O
this	O
place	O
just	O
for	O
some	O
drinks	O
.	O

Also	O
kinda	O
loud	O
when	O
the	O
fan	O
was	O
running	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
around	O
three	O
years	O
,	O
maybe	O
four	O
years	O
ago	O
.	O

I	O
finally	O
decided	O
on	O
this	O
laptop	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
right	O
price	B-ASP
for	O
what	O
I	O
need	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
called	O
apple	O
and	O
no	O
solution	O
.	O

The	O
touchpad	O
is	O
extremely	O
sensitive	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
drawback	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
would	O
change	O
about	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
mouse	O
keys	O
.	O

Keyboard	O
could	O
use	O
some	O
trimming	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
fix	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	B-ASP
.	O

Overall	O
,	O
I	O
experienced	O
a	O
huge	O
change	O
in	O
that	O
my	O
mac	B-ASP
runs	O
pretty	O
fast	O
compared	O
to	O
my	O
old	O
PC	B-ASP

the	O
place	O
we	O
bought	O
it	O
from	O
said	O
that	O
after	O
they	O
send	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
gateway	O
4	O
times	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
us	O
a	O
new	O
one	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
nt	O
understand	O
how	O
anyone	O
can	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
product	B-ASP
worth	O
purchasing	O

This	O
system	O
came	O
loaded	O

I	O
'm	O
definitely	O
not	O
hard	O
on	O
laptops	B-ASP

guarantee	O
100	O
%	O
that	O
no	O

The	O

Oh	O

,	O
do	O
n't	O
forget	O
the	O
expensive	O
shipping	B-ASP
to	O
and	O
from	O
HP	O

My	O

there	O
still	O

Its	O
fast	O

another	O

constantly	O
had	O
to	O

it	O

really	O
settling	O
into	O

I	O
found	O
myself	O
wanting	O
something	O

not	O
to	O

that	O
the	O

had	O

ever	O
since	O
I	O
bought	B-ASP
it	O
about	O
4	O
years	O

When	O
I	O
called	O
Toshiba	O

anything	O

even	O
though	O

it	O
was	O
still	O
broken	O
sent	O
it	O
out	O

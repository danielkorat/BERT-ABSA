All	O

that	O
the	O

My	O

Hyde	I-ASP

for	O
our	O

and	O
to	O
our	O

I	O
can	O
understand	O
the	O
prices	B-ASP
if	O
it	O
served	O
better	O
food	B-ASP
,	O
like	O
some	O
Chinese	O
restaurants	O
in	O

We	O
could	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
meal	O
of	O
the	O
yummy	O
dumplings	B-ASP
from	O
the	O
dumpling	O
menu	O

Be	O
prepared	O
to	O
wait	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
place	B-ASP
is	O
pretty	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
very	O

and	O
the	O

Any	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
reservation	B-ASP
you	O
'll	O
wait	O
for	O
max	O
5	O
minutes	O

at	O
the	O

Go	O
hungry	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
dinner	B-ASP
in	O
Manhattan	O

cost	O
$	O
400.00	O
where	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
swept	O
off	O

I	O
like	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
dont	O
get	O
me	O
wrong	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
jsut	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-ASP
who	O
work	O
there	O
are	O
evil	O
and	O
incompetent	O
!!	O

They	O
do	O

the	O

that	O

be	O
a	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
annoying	O

they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
squeeze	O
me	O
in	O
at	O
6	O

i	O
called	O

told	O
me	O
they	O
'd	O
treat	O
us	O
well	O
for	O
the	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
spot	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
overpriced	O

But	O
the	O

was	O
good	O

We	O
ordered	O
the	O
chicken	B-ASP

what	O
we	O

all	O

they	O
did	O
give	O
a	O
15	O

,	O
was	O
n't	O

I	O
suggest	O

what	O

the	O

The	O

One	O
of	O
the	O

then	O
things	O

The	O

the	O

it	O
is	O

it	O
a	O

Of	O

I	O

A	O
tip	O
for	O
people	O
looking	O
into	O
this	O
computer	O
:	O

DO	O
NOT	O
BUY	O

IT	O
save	O
up	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
money	O
and	O
buy	O
a	O
computer	O
that	O

Got	O
this	O

But	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
they	O
(	O
the	O
company	O
)	O
would	O
not	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
anything	O
about	O
my	O
problem	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
no	O
luck	O
with	O
staples	O
or	O
HP	B-ASP
to	O
resolve	O
this	O
problem	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
now	O
making	O
a	O
point	O
to	O
avoid	O
their	O
products	O

and	O
I	O
hope	O
my	O
experience	B-ASP
can	O
serve	O
as	O
a	O
warning	O
to	O
you	O
as	O
well	O

The	O

has	O

nothing	O

from	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
bought	B-ASP
it	O

i	O
do	O
nt	O
understand	O
why	O
i	O
spent	O
twice	O
as	O
much	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
laptop	O
rather	O
than	O
a	O

when	O
my	O

completely	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
at	O

eight	O

and	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
outstanding	O

this	O

The	O
configuration	B-ASP

perfect	O
for	O
my	O

the	O
two	O

use	O
it	O
regularly	O

Apparently	O
under	O
the	O

there	O
are	O
2	O

screws	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
screen	O

moved	O
back	O

,	O
they	O
come	O
loose	O

Just	O
bit	O
the	O
bullet	O
and	O
bought	O
the	O

hoping	O
it	O
will	O
last	O
a	O

longer	O
…	O

This	O
is	O
basically	O
the	O
best	O

I	O

To	O

For	O
the	O

what	O
I	O

out	O

it	O
has	O

I	O
also	O

a	O
review	O

it	O

its	O
awesome	O

They	O
basically	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
the	O

no	O

does	O

even	O

The	O
macbook	B-ASP

really	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
lottery	O
at	O
this	O

I	O
have	O

that	O

Somehow	O
the	O

meets	O
all	O
my	O
needs	O
for	O
work	O

pleasure	O
while	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O
transition	O
would	O
be	O
difficult	O
at	O
best	O
and	O
would	O
take	O
some	O
time	O
to	O
fully	O
familiarize	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
new	O

Finally	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
reach	O
a	O
young	O
lady	O
in	O
California	O
and	O
ordered	O
the	O
machine	O
and	O
was	O
subsequently	O
given	O
a	O

If	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
your	O
first	O

then	O
I	O
would	O
highly	O
suggest	O
that	O
you	O
take	O

of	O
the	O

that	O

about	O

because	O
it	O
may	O
have	O
a	O

it	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O

The	O

However	O
,	O
this	O

has	O
a	O
fatal	O

that	O
i	O
discovered	O
merely	O
a	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
call	O

It	O

I	O

five	O

I	O

Most	O
laptops	B-ASP

are	O
difficult	O
to	O

Waited	O
on	O
getting	O
this	O

it	O

been	O
a	O
great	O

They	O

it	O

So	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O

the	O
first	O
few	O
weeks	O

I	O
love	O

Cheaper	O
than	O
buying	B-ASP
it	O
@	O

too	O

So	O
buyer	O
beware	O
when	O
buying	B-ASP
Toshiba	B-ASP

So	O
,	O
I	O
paid	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
LG	O
notebook	O

at	O
Alexandra	O

they	O

When	O
you	O
call	O

you	O
were	O
routed	O

someone	O

was	O
in	O
another	O

did	O
not	O

what	O
they	O

Seems	O
to	O
slow	O

I	O

the	O

(	O

never	O
owned	O
a	O

,	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
purchase	O

because	O
my	O
school	B-ASP

It	O

all	O
the	O
speed	O

power	O
I	O
could	O

The	O

Just	O
What	O
I	O

is	O
considering	O
buying	O

Acer	O

I	O
seriously	O

you	O

The	O

I	O

I	O

I	O
have	O

this	O

It	O

very	O

not	O

The	O

the	O
two	O

then	O

The	O

seems	O
to	O
always	O
perform	O
so	O
much	O
better	O
than	O

Because	O
we	O

will	O
be	O
looking	B-ASP

I	O
LOVE	O
IT	O

But	O
,	O
like	O
I	O
said	O

the	O
only	O
reason	O
I	O
do	O

shunned	O

acually	O
believe	O
the	O

with	O
the	O
Nvidia	O

still	O
requires	O

Gradually	O
the	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
product	B-ASP
!	O

I	O
've	O
had	O
my	O
computer	B-ASP
for	O
2	O
weeks	O
already	O
and	O
it	O
works	O
perfectly	O
.	O

Very	O
small	O
and	O
portable	O
I	O
've	O
had	O
this	O
netbook	O

about	O
12	O
hrs	O
now	O

and	O
It	O
's	O
better	O
than	O
expected	O
.	O

The	O
difference	O
is	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
of	O
fun	O
using	O
the	O
laptop	O
now	O
,	O
still	O
learning	O
the	O
Apple	O
navigation	O
,	O
but	O
is	O
fun	O
and	O
comes	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
cool	O
apps	B-ASP
.	O

If	O
upgrade	O
is	O
possible	O
to	O
the	O
full	O
Windows	O
7	O
,	O
then	O
I	O
will	O
truly	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
happy	O
geek	O
.	O

The	O
touchpad	O
is	O
very	O
intuitive	O
,	O
so	O
much	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
want	O
to	O
use	O
buttons	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
recommend	O
this	O
product	B-ASP
to	O
anyone	O

But	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
potentially	O
hundreds	O
or	O
thousands	O
in	O
the	O
near	O

.	O

I	O
always	O
use	O
a	O
backup	O
hard	O
disk	B-ASP
to	O
store	O
important	O
files	O
at	O
all	O
times	O

I	O
ordered	O
through	O
MacMall	O
,	O
which	O
saved	O
me	O
the	O
sales	O
tax	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
incurred	O
buying	O
locally	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
wonderful	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
dangerous	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
emitting	O
heat	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
number	O
pad	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
the	O
keyboard	B-ASP
which	O
is	O
a	O
bummer	O
.	O

I	O
wish	O
the	O
volume	O
could	O
be	O
louder	O
and	O
the	O
mouse	B-ASP
did	O
nt	O
break	O
after	O
only	O
a	O
month	O
.	O

I	O
bought	B-ASP
it	O
to	O
use	O
in	O
college	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
perfect	O
.	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
to	O
my	O
son	O
who	O
uses	O
it	O
for	O
graphic	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
this	O
computer	B-ASP
to	O
anyone	O
searching	O
for	O
the	O
perfect	O
laptop	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
the	O
battery	B-ASP
life	I-ASP
is	O
amazing	O
.	O

Finally	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
MAC	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
choices	O
of	O
which	O
PC	O
's	O
to	O
buy	O
and	O
EVERYONE	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
MAC	O
said	O
"	O
buy	O
a	O

It	O
has	O
come	O
into	O

my	O

and	O
it	O
is	O

to	O
fit	O
it	O
in	O
an	O
already	O

My	O

a	O

Chatting	O
with	O

I	O

Took	O
the	O

on	O
a	O

I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
whatever	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
without	O
lugging	O
a	O
much	O

So	O
,	O
the	O
hard	O
disk	B-ASP
capacity	O
really	O
does	O
n't	O
matter	O
to	O
me	O

Oh	O

I	O

The	O

by	O
half-	O

a	O
full	O

that	O
is	O
obviously	O
unnecessary	O
,	O
reduces	O
the	O
screen	O
size	B-ASP

increases	O
the	O

It	O
's	O
fast	O
,	O
light	O

and	O
simple	O
to	O

Everything	O
about	O
this	O
computer	B-ASP
is	O
easy	O
to	O
use	O

I	O
know	O
that	O
ASUS	O
is	O

for	O
making	O

this	O
is	O
the	O
worst	O

experience	I-ASP
that	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
had	O

Who	O

will	O

I	O

Overall	O

It	O

The	O

to	O
find	O
out	O
that	O
the	O

apparently	O
because	O

The	O
best	O
thing	O
about	O
this	O

is	O
the	O
price	O
along	O
with	O
some	O
of	O

I	O

TOSHIBA	B-ASP
WILL	O

thing	O
is	O
that	O

I	O
get	O
a	O

of	O
compliments	O
on	O

speaking	O
as	O
someone	O
who	O
regularly	O
commutes	O
on	O
a	O

I	O
can	O
attest	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
perfect	O
size	B-ASP
computer	I-ASP
if	O
you	O

I	O
was	O

I	O
would	O
definitely	O
not	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
using	O
a	O

after	O
using	O

My	O
life	O
has	O
been	O
enriched	O
since	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
using	O
Apple	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
total	O
of	O
5	O
different	O
laptop	O
from	O
many	O
different	O
manufactures	O

But	O
while	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
big	O
advantage	O
(	O
as	O
you	O
may	O
know	O
from	O
the	O
company	O
s	O
recent	O
commercials	O
)	O
there	O
are	O
other	O
things	O
to	O
consider	O
before	O
going	O
with	O
Apple	O
.	O

The	O
Mac	B-ASP
version	B-ASP
of	O
Microsoft	O
Office	O
is	O
cheaper	O
than	O
buying	B-ASP
the	O
actual	O
and	O
works	O
just	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

You	O
will	O
love	O
this	O
macbook	B-ASP
if	O
you	O
choose	O
to	O
buy	B-ASP
it	O
.	O

Runs	B-ASP
fast	O
and	O
the	O
regular	O
layout	O
keyboard	B-ASP
is	O
so	O
much	O
better	O
.	O

The	O
difference	O
is	O
the	O
Toshiba	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
memory	O
and	O
hard	O
drive	B-ASP
space	O

I	O
'm	O
going	O
back	O

DELL	O

The	O
battery	O
life	O
also	O
does	O
n't	O
keep	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
claim	O

but	O
still	O
I	O
think	O
macbook	O
is	O
much	O
ahead	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
pack	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
smartest	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
was	O
take	O
my	O
time	O
to	O
compare	O
laptops	O
before	O
making	O
my	O
purchase	O
.	O

Since	O
I	O
've	O
had	O
this	O
computer	O
I	O
've	O
only	O
used	O
the	O
trackpad	B-ASP
because	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
nice	O
and	O
smooth	O
.	O

My	O
one	O
complaint	O
with	O
this	O
laptop	B-ASP
is	O
that	O
I	O
've	O
noticed	O
an	O
electronic	O
fuzz	O
sound	O
coming	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
headphone	O
jack	O
when	O
headphones	O
are	O
plugged	O
in	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
slow	O
and	O
one	O
day	B-ASP
i	O
hope	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
buy	O
something	O
else	O

When	O
I	O
am	O
at	O

That	O
's	O
how	O

it	O
was	O

The	O

The	O

to	O

the	O
most	O

Sony	B-ASP

I	O

the	O
black	O

two	O

My	O

recently	O
purchased	B-ASP
an	O
Apple	B-ASP
MacBook	B-ASP

our	O

fell	O
in	O

with	O

asked	O
for	O
one	O
for	O
her	O

THIS	O
is	O
what	O
a	O

So	O
if	O
anyones	O

the	O

I	O
bought	B-ASP

it	O
turns	O

We	O
carry	O
the	O

very	O
good	O

and	O
the	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
wrong	O

I	O
like	O
this	O
machine	B-ASP
because	O
its	O
very	O
lightweight	O
...	O

Could	O
nt	O
not	O
use	O
it	O

No	O
luck	O

although	O
I	O
waited	O
for	O

on	O
the	O

Visited	O

they	O

the	O

many	O
phonecalls	O
(	O

Also	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
size	B-ASP
and	O
consistancy	O
of	O
the	O
laptop	O

,	O
some	O
websites	O
would	O

even	O

the	O

The	O
most	O

part	B-ASP

me	O
as	O
a	O
PC	B-ASP
user	I-ASP
is	O
the	O
startup	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O
you	O

the	O

Congratulations	O

if	O

so	O
I	O
went	O

played	O
around	O
with	O
the	O
IOS	O

it	O
was	O

a	O

Also kinda loud when the fan was running.
This was around three years, maybe four years ago.
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
I called apple and no solution.
The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys.
Keyboard could use some trimming.
It's a good fix, in my opinion.
Overall, I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC.
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one.
I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.
This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter.
I'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100% that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence.
The brand is tarnished in my heart.
Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.
My Macbook was worth (after 3 years of use!) $375.
The screen is nice and the images comes very clear, the keyboard and the fit just feels right.
I've tried going back to XL but there still problems.
Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.
He didn't work for sony, he was just approved to fix their crappy products.
Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.
I needed a driver for my HP and they would not help me with out me paying over $50 for it.
You will not regret buying this computer!
  I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
My last laptop was a 17" ASUS gaming machine, which performed admirably, but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life, I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome, not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago.
When I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn't offer any technical support.
Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.
Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.
-When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them, I tried to call.
  I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.
Best money I ever spent.
Good price.
This one still has the CD slot.
The only thing I don't understand is that the resolution of the screen isn't high enough for some pages, such as Yahoo!Mail.
It was quite easy.
The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!
I'm still within the one year warranty but the repair "depot"  has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not  covered.
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price, but totally worth it for a good piece of mind.
I have used both PCs and Macs and I have to say that I really really love my Mac Book Pro.
Adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.
The system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.
My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates.
Now mainboard is broken, have to wait for a new one.
As a user of a PC, I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself "Getting the job done quicker.
I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac, but MS Office doesn't even come with most pc laptops.
PDF files can be viewed instantly.
  There's literally no way to make it sing with Vista.
I saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what I know now,I would not buy it at that price.
Will not buy another Toshiba, this is my second, not happy w/ either.
Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer
I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer.
The laptop was very easy to set up.
The SuperDrive is quiet.
Thank you so much for the great item.
The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room.
taking notes, research, an online class and such and didn't want to spend too much on my first machine.
From the start, when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine.
Seems to me that's the best way to get Apple's attention.
The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.
We love the size of the screen, although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around.
No I am generous calling it slow.
Let's just get this out of the way, I love Apple!
Apple is unmatched in product quality,aesthetics,craftmanship, and customer service.
I had never owned a Mac before;
  I was WRONG!
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping.
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur.
I wanted it for it's mobility and man, this little bad boy is very nice.
There is no HDMI receptacle, nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device.
I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is.
I pondered very long over this decision.
  So, buyers beware!
Just a black screen!
The graphics are stunning.
2.The wireless card is low quality.
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.
Maybe this is virus related, maybe not, but the computer has locked up many times, and on two occasions, the screen has simply gone black.
When we bought our new HP comouter in Dec. of 2008, we wanted Windows XP, but were told it would cost an extra $159, so we went with Vista.
We purchase the Dell XPS several years ago for my home business.
It wouldn't fit in most 17-inch bags.
I have used PC's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy.
Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there's nothing like a Mac.
  Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.
Files as well would become lost, deleted or corrupted.
More relieved than anything.
It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.
Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.
I still see the benefits of a PC when I do not know how to do something on my mac.
By the way teachers, they offer a discount which helps!
To those thinking about switching, do it and do not look back!
Easy to set up and go!
It works great for general internet use, Microsoft Office apps, home bookkeeping, etc.
The only thing that I have, is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters, would help if it was a little lighter then it is.
User upgradeable RAM and HDD.
I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment.
Which it did not have, only 3 USB 2 ports.
Macs are designed for the "frontal lobe challenged" people out there.
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi.
Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
I also made a recovery USB stick.
It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.
I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college.
For some odd reasons the computer doesn't reconize the operation system.
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack, I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere.
Theres also iDVD, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.
the mouse buttons are hard to push.
I had to re-install Windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges.
The Toshiba Mini Notebook, Model NB 305-N410BL, is a great little computer.
This computer is exceptionally thin for it's screen size and processing power.
Overall, still a very nice machine.
To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
Yes, I have it on the highest available setting.
Considering another computer should be out of the question
You can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps, it needs signature to pove that you received it.
I love my Samsung TV and Galaxy S smartphone, but this Netbook was a very poor computer.
Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell.
NO good.
The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid.
Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel.
Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
I am very happy I bought this Mac, well worth the extra money.
Battery life needs more life.
If that is the case, then I am completely happy
When considering a Mac, look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag.
I saved about $100 plus tax ordering on Amazon and since I have prime, it arrived overnight for just $3.99 more.
YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR.
(I had been a Windows/Linux user before this) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.
Added an iMac about 2 years later.
  The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.
Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba, I went with an Asus G73JH-x3.
And not to mention after using it for a few months or so, the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying.
Bought with a credit card.
I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one.
It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.
-When battery life went to 4 hours or less, took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair (26th of August).
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.
Highly recommended!
It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys.
This is especially disheartening when Apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals.
It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.
I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop.
I did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since.
It wasn't worth it.
My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.
When i finally held it in my hands i kissed it, yes i did.
THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO.
Startup times are incredibly long: over two minutes.
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3.
Simple details, crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops.
All you have to do is turn it on and it works.
For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $1000
No big deal.
The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed.
I absolutely love my mac!
I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it.
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program.
The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours, but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours.
I LOVE it!
That is my only complaint!
I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it.
I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.
With awesome graphics and assuring security, it's perfect!
This was the second computer and brand bought that day.
It is quiet and a real joy to watch work.
My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit.
The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.
After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer.
I highly recommend that you buy this product.
I do not recommend this company or their products!!!!
The quality, engineering design and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop.
They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer, they paid postage and whatnot, but when I got my computer back it still wasn't running right, and now my CD drive wasn't reading anything!
I am a wife, mom and a school teacher and a college student.
It's a great product for a great price!
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again.
It rarely works and when it does it's incredibly slow.
The screen isn't huge, but that doesn't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV.
They click.
This computer is the ideal college companion.
Don't buy this model.
Clear picture on it and everything.
All my devises “talk” to each other.
It's so useable and responsive.
I'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up.
This is no exception.
Excellent product for the money.
WIth the upgraded memory, the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once!
I love this piece of equipment, It will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a MacBook Pro.
I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7, what about us Vista users?  They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system.
It did not have all the features I expected it to have.
I WILL NEVER AGAIN buy another Acer, not will I buy Gateway, or eMachine as they are all from the same company.
I will never buy another HP computer.
The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town- lots of people, little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector, etc.
It is so simple to use, I use it more than my desktop.
I had to get Apple Customer Support to correct the problem.
  three years is a decent life, but this must make it to graduation and beyond.
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer.
The price is great for this model, I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room.
The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus.
Set up was easy.
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE----BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY.
Also, the extended warranty was a problem.
After years of using PCs, a new Mac user is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer.
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's "like new," I might have 8 months next time.
Also, because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer, some websites wouldn't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems.
Well, maybe more like week one.
So you out of of notebook and money.
Dells are ok, HPs aren't that good, but Macs or Fantastic.
it was shooting sparks!
The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well.
I've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems.
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service.
I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke.
Actually, I had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn't have sound!
I don't know why I didn't make the switch sooner...o ya because it's expensive.
It is a much more streamlined system for adding programs, using the internet, and doing other things everyone does on a computer.
Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without.
The apple systems are over priced luxurys that arn't worth what they are being charged for, this model's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name.
Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode.
It's shiny and it's pretty.
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up
It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.
It's all a bit magical.
They are about the same size keys.
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.
It's fast, it's easy easy easy to set up, easy to hook to my wireless network.
Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me.
Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached.
At first, the computer seemed a great deal--seemingly high-end specs for a low, low price.
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i've had it.
This is the third in a series of MacBooks starting with a Black MacBook.
The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
It's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion!
Great Performance and Quality.
NOT WITH APPLE.
I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.
  By this time I was regretting ever SEEING this machine on the shelf!
That's the downside for me.
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.
There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.
Posted Nov 8, 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook.
Keyboard is reasonable size.
They transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can't understand what they are saying.
It is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student.
It's the inside that is truly wonderful.
I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards, but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had.
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
big mistake!
As for the laptop, this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years.
Performance is much much better on the Pro, especially if you install an SSD on it.
Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough.
It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.
The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.
   I'm a professional consultant, and a client needed work on her machine.
It's not inexpensive but the Hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small.
One of the smartest thing I did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase.
Very light and easily maneuverable.
The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.
Every day I had this computer, something failed on it.
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
I did a review on it, its awesome.
5 months dead again.
I have had it 9 months and it is already a $250 loss.
Purchased as a gift for a friend.
Very disappointed!
They don't just look good; they deliver excellent performance.
Awesome graphics!
It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was.
The battery life seems to be very good, and have had no issues with it.
Seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the Dell
  The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket.
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been.
The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite.
  Unless you don't care how long it takes to get going, find something else.
it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop.
This has happened three times so far.
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
That's very possible, but since they don't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine, I was stuck until Windows 7 came out.
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS.
I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market.
Features such as the Dashboard (allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator, weather forecast, movie times, calendar, computer post its etc.
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside.
The machine itself is alright.
Currently if I use the laptop I can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.
My main reason to convert was the imovie program.
I like iTunes, the apparent security, the Mini form factor, all the nice graphics stuff.
This is my first LG product.
Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on.
It's absolutely wonderful and worth the price!
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the "service" when it is called the "service center".
  Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes.
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.
The 4 USB ports are nice, but the two on the side only work now and then.
breaks easily.
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs.
I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for.
My laptop now has no battery.
Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it.
The delivery was fast, and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again.
It made the computer much easier to use and navigate.
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $300 less (he got a pc).
 THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it's a big name but they are a piece of garbage.
the two of us use it regularly.
Being a PC user my whole life, it's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I'm finding my way around.
That day!
I was given a demonstration of Windows 8.
Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs.
I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed.
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
I will never purchase a HP again ever.
What can I say.
I bought a cordless mouse for it, but don't always take it out;
  It is just slow slow slow.
The Notebook PC,Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me.
I am used to computers with windows so I am having a little difficulty finding my way around.
My MacBook Pro works like a dream, it has never overheated, or even been slightly warm for that matter.
I purchased a MacBook Pro and this to replace a couple of HP units that I was using.
The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.
The pricing is very competitive.
Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV.
The Macbook is also made better, my computer has never got a virus, and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it.
Buy this if you like being tortured, teased, frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac.
The port is secured to motherboard so when this  happens you can't see the plug at all, it's just gone.
This comes in very handy for me as an educator.
DEFINITELY recommended!!!
Before, I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer's site.
The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team, which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from.
The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.
Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing.
Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed, etc.
I am very happy with this laptop.
You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish.
When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing.
It is the worst laptop ever
Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world.
My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.
I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP, but I use the touchpad 90% of the time.
At $1899 to start, this is no cheap machine.
in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working.
My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I couldn't get online to find out why.
This is my second MacBook.
Needless to say a PC that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!
My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift, and i'm totally (almost kind of maybe definitely) obsessed with it.
It's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk.
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner.
  However the frozen screens kept happening.
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off.
It shouldn't happen like that, I don't have any design app open or anything.
My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!
I loved it then, but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet.
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more...
I expected so as it's an Apple product, but I was glad to see my expectations exceeded, this is THE laptop to buy right now.
And inconvenient!
Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
  They told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn't need  to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it.
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.
Probably won't work either.
I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon didn't have it yet.
i would never go back any more, i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone.
I blame the Mac OS.
 I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!
This computer was bought because I wanted "top of the line", fast, reliable, HA.
-Apparently, contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints.
The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
NO more Lenovo for me.
I can do everything I could before, only faster and more efficiently.
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $962 :).
One, owning a mac is essentially a full production studio (in the case of a mac book a portable version).
The speakers could have been better but it wasn't a deal breaker... this is a great little laptop... love it!
The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don't want to bother them with bright lighting, it is very convenient to have a darker, softer lit screen.
Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous.
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it isn't $1400 and smaller.
go for it!
very very slow laptop.
May be better for the occasional web surfer.
After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs.
It may take a little getting used to but you don't have to worry about viruses or other headaches.
The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness.
GREAT INVESTMENT!
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it.
After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.
The 17 in Macbook Pro has been a wonderful addition.
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend.
only good thing is the graphics quality.
Laptop is to be used like a Netbook.
Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.
I've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates.
So, the hard disk capacity really doesn't matter to me.
Right size and weight for portability.
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.
Great laptop that offers many great features!
I love the feel of the key board, as well as the trackpad.
-got it back 3 months later
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands.
-No backlit keyboard, but not an issue for me.
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.
Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.
I am still in the process of learning about its features.
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.
  I'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba.
Comfterbale to use light easy to transport.
In addition, there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.
Fine if you have a touch screen.
I've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye'd the computer when I took it out of my bag.
To list a few: They tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns, as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up.
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.
Very disappointed with Apple.
On 3 July 2004, I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $150
Got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college.
But I was wrong.
I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town.
I am so happy to have purchased this computer.
I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.
It was fast, and it was "different".
I grew up in a design family so it only made sense.
Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops.
I also experience the same with my MacBook Air.
The Bluetooth was not there at all, and the fingerprint reader driver would be there, but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done.
I was ready to take it back for a refund, but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed.
I upgraded it's RAM to 2GB, I am very happy with it.
Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling.
The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD.
Screen is bright and gorgeous.
Apple is living up to its name with the mini and, for our needs, it's perfect.
This is my first apple laptop.
I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair.
So much faster and sleeker looking.
They are simpler to use.
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.
Still, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.
I am ADDICTED to photo booth!
The love part of my relationship with this laptop doesn't take very long.
One more tip, please purchase this model and get a 4GB stick of RAM to save you $10
The thunderbolt port is awesome!
It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site, then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works.
I'm very happy with this machine!
Buyer Beware.
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.
A scratch on a $1,500 MacBook is unforgivable.
It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part.
They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.
HELP, HELP, OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER.
The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC.
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued, apparently because of known motherboard problems.
A great computer for light home use and business use.
Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis.
I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6".
I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
It is not ideal for children because of the temp.
I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet!
*5 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer.
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great.
  Worse, for the price I could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine.
The latest and mightiest Macbook pro 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of June 2009.
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop.
The Awesomest of the awesomest.
The service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and wasn't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect.
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.
My husband uses it mostly for games, email and music.
But, I would recommend this product.
(3DMARK6 score is only 8500).
It's now all commodity hardware.
Those things are very important - vital even!
Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.
Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger.
Do you ever think HP would do that? NEVER!
Other installed features, such as certain printer software, are also most attractive.
He LEFT ME, instructions on what to do when this comes up, or that comes up......
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment.
Who couldn't love a DVD burner, 80-gigabyte HD, and fairly new graphics chip? As I soon discovered, though, there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more: they use higher-quality components that are faster, better-configured, and end up lasting a lot longer.
The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.
Unfortunately, the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again, I have to say i hated it.
Though the picture, video, and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software Im used to (CS5) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers.
I took it back for a full refund.
All in all, I'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop, and with HP as a whole.
I hope to edit this in the next few hours, I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7.
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.
If you buy, pray you dont have major prolems.
I would like at least a 4 hr. battery life.
Still pretty pricey, but I've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund, and finally got to use it.
I can do pretty much 75% of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table.
This is my second MACBOOK PRO and it's better than ever.
i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.
wonderful features.
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
I've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts.
  English must have been his third or fourth language.
  Then I've fixed the DC jack (inside the unit), rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop, replaced the power brick.
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 (in PC enabled with USB3)I was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7.
Great things come in small "packages.
It works fine with our wireless and they've had not problems.
  It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.
Would do business again.
I just got this laptop for college, and so far I am very happy with it.
The battery life was shorter than expected.
By week two, my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much.
I will upgrade the ram myself (because with this model you can you can do it) later on.
Needs constant repair.
1st hand experience is very important, especially for a new customer.
It seems to be incompatible with everything else.
Out of all the laptops I have owned, this is by far the best!
And if you do a lot of writing, editing is a problem since there is no  forward delete  key.
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse.
i love the keyboard and the screen.
This worked just fine.
It makes a great gift.
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro, which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro.
it was a tough choice.
I am loving the fast performance also.
I'm new - just switched from years of PC frustration.
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.
Which is what I did, check out my ACER 5517!
I babyed the heck out of it and i still do.
The new MacBook is lightyears ahead of my old white plastic MacBook circa 2006.
Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying.
and plenty of storage with 250 gb(though I will upgrade this and the ram..)
They say sorry out of warranty.
It has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.
Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload.
Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.
Not to mention, the battery life is absolutely amazing.
The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .
A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it's spec quite easily.
Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions, hope you have your own copies.
This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.
The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.
In my house, HP is a nasty word.
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily.
By Air sounds more like by truck to Me.
Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since.
It's ok but doesn't have a disk drive which I didn't know until after I bought it.
I can't imagine EVER buying a PC again!
I do not like too much Windows 8.
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIFIC!!
Its also FUN to use!
I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology, downloading pictures and graphic design.
The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.
I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.
It's annoying very much and I won't ever buy any Acer products.
Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened.
Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date.
What's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision.
I'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes.
Besides the great look, it is a great machine.
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty, related to the graphics card.
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years, I decided to buy MacBook Pro.
I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst.
And in 6 months, there have been no freezing up and no blue, purple, black or any other type of screen.
All the yada-yada.
Great value, fast delivery- Computer works as if brand new, no problems, very pleased
And Toshiba is a quality supplier.
Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.
Nice packing.
But I do NOT like Win8.
I'm pretty sure when I bought it, my bank account went 'ouch!
I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am.
I thought it would be a simple job.
My bag just got a little lighter.
It is very well built.
I didn't want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice.
I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.
It can't get any better.
Since I never really got to use this, I can't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them.
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I've never used a computer that performs better.
It is not even a year old yet, so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone.
I just plug this into my 22" Monitor and the speedy MacOSX performs just as well on this dual-core that my Dell did with Windows 7 with a quad-core.
It was always getting froze up.
The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing.
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it.
I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer.
That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software, the speakers and the subwoofer I got (that WAS worth the money), the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer, the extended life battery and the Docking port.
No viruses.
The last new mac I bought was in 1998.
My kids (and dogs) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them.
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY.
Luckily, Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one, but instead I got a refund and bought a mac.
ive never had a problem with it!
I have a laptop as my regular computer, but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag.
I fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now I could not imagine going back to an acer at all.
, Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).
It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop!
I like the laptop overall.
my information was all lost (my fault, I know, but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac, the paragon of all computers!
With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must.
Also, macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!
Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition.
I should have kept my big, old HP.
If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7, then I will truly be a very happy geek.
  The computer is so slow, even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.
Programs would crash all the time, and it turned out to be a very unstable, unreliable laptop for me.
might have to buy one for me now, since I use it all the time.
-Stay away from Apple, or hope you laptop does not break down.
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.
There is no "tools" menu.
Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors!!!!
I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).
Received the product promptly and without any issues.
I would buy it again in a heartbeat!
My children won't even use it  for their school work.
It is so speedy.
I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this  laptop.
I use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.
It was wonderful deal for the wonderful product.
I do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.
Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP.
I love the 15" MacBook Pro.
I thought that it will be fine, if i do some settings.
I was a little weary at purchasing another 13" macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around.
The graphics were awful and the warranty isn't even worth the cheap payment on the computer.
This laptop serves all my needs.
It's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it.
Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college.
another problem.
I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop!
I had gotten this model for  $1199.00 on my State's tax-free weekend and had a $100 off coupon for a MacBook at the local BestBuy!
Very powerful especially for the money.
And if you are switching from a pc I hilghy sugest this one.
I wanted to spend around $700 to $800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop.
The display is beyond horrible.
It's catatonic.
But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future.
I use my friends and family's $2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP, well, I'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone!
This is perfect for her field.
It works great and I am so happy I bought it.
I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.
It's fast, quiet, incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models.
It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.
Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
After looking at all the pros and cons, I decided on the Macbook Pro.
Theres always something wrong with it, wether it be some virus you can't track down, or it overheats, sometimes even catches on fire, you just can't use it.
Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved, worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac, the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior.
It also does not have bluetooth.
Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag.
  When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.
This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)!
The performance is awesome.
It is small enough to fit in one of my purses!
I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!
  Before we got this laptop, had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems.
If so, you may be having similar problems.
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer.
returned it.
My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC.
I was considering buying the Air, but in reality, this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient, even though it's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier.
Waiting for the i7 was well worth it, great value for the price.
sounds like a typewriter, but if you can get past that, this is a great laptop for a little money!
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.
The battery doesn't last long but I'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem.
Garageband is easy to work with, like all the other apple applications I've had experience with.
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards.
When I am next to my router on my HP I get full service, on my Eee PC I get 3 bars.
-They reported that the computer is in their headquarters.
I just bought the new MacBook Pro, the 13" model, and I can't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports.
Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily.
I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner.
Well, maybe I was just very unlucky.
It discharges too quickly.
I'm extremely happy with my purchase as I now have the portable power I have been looking for.
Came fully loaded - good.
I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.
I'm so glad I purchased a Mac and not another PC!!!
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you.
So in late March, early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had.
Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.
I Love my new computer!
The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly.
Whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows (or Winblows, as I like ot call it).
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it...
The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.
  Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing;
No Viruses!
  upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told, was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired.
It is extremely fast and very compact.
If you need an affordable, entry-level laptop, this will fit the bill.
I am not happy at all with the product I purchased.
It's a joke.
My last computer, a Toshiba, cost only $400, and worked like a charm for many years.
I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay, they are in no way comparable to the Mac.
It is a cheap throw together.
I returned it to Best Buy on the ninteenth of April.
Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09.
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13" RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered (to me.
The difference is phenomenal.
I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers.
But sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough (this could be because Im used to my Lenovo 10 tablet now) plus this is a great size if I want to unplug the external keyboard, mouse, and monitor to take it with me when I take photos and video.
You can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia.
  i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes.
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.
but it  has a major design flaw.
Sound card is limited though.
See retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop.
Returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable.
I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.
I did not take the class and wish that I would have.
Web browsing is very quick with Safari browser.
Very fast and efficient!
I love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).
The ease of set up was terrific.
For me, five stars is not enough.
It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived.
It is well worth the money it cost, Very good investment.
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.
I like the lighted screen at night.
I am most impressed with the programming, including the iPhoto.
I haven't used it for anything high tech yet, but I love it already.
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
5) Cut my losses and sold it for parts
  Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad, keys, and casing.
When I turned it on, nothing.
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but, I haven't seen them yet.
But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard.
The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did.
The item received was exactly as identified.
and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy.
One bad thing is it gets hot.
No hassle and no complaints.
The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing.
  while it was barely a bargin in the begining, i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others.
Either way I'm furious.
I had read online that some users were having sound problems.
the features are great, the only thing it needs is better speakers.
This is what I call a good after sales service.
I'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product.
Sent unit back and it's been two months.
There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.
I would recommend not buying this product.
I have experienced no problems, works as anticipated.
Of course, eMachines cannot be made entirely to blame for this computer's woes;
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure.
returned it to walmart.
I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around.
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem.
In the short time of one month since the 2012 Mac Mini was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising.
I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed.
Browsing, also, was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).
It doesnt get hot like my PC, with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it.
As a lifelong Windows user, I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.
-Called MacHouse Amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement, no answer.
Wonderful zooming.
The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now, but keep in mind that Apple started it all.
Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts.
Also, HDD secures inside using rails, and there is only one set on the main hard drive.
The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.
however, I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton.
Seems a much more economical way to get into Apple than their other computers.
All for such a great price.
They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular.
Highly recommend for daily use.
Apparently well-built and gorgeous to look at, the i5 MacBook Pro is a winning combination of price and performance.
And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed.
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to!
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles.
The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do, and I didn't know what to do....
Best Buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764.
I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now.
The built quality is really good, I was so Happy and excited about this Product.
) I also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store.
See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it.
Obviously, this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way.
I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8.
It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it.
For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations.
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!
But I'm still learning so can't rate it yet for everything.
We both recently got new laptops.
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks.
Again, the same problem, the right speaker did not work.
*IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP, THIS IS NOT IT!
This is another reason to like the Mac.
) And printing from either word processor is an adventure.
It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.
I have three words: Piece of Junk!
The exterior is absolutely gorgeous.
Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems, as well.
The battery life is excellent- 6-7 hours without charging.
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.
I couldn't be more pleased.
The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade.
The baterry is very longer.
I can't say enough good for it!
I connect a LaCie 2Big external drive via the firewire 800 interface, which is useful for Time Machine.
Couldn't have asked for more!
  Taking it back to Best Buy I found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken (manuf issue).
  Until I bought the Dell, I thought you just looked for what you wanted (size, software, options, hardware) and purchase the best deal you could find.
They are not.
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $150 plus.
It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, "74%, plugged in, not charging"), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.
Now, the next issue I had freaked me out.
Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support.
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.
Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.
We carry the netbook around here and there, hence it's kinda of irritating when the LCD just "slide" downwards.
By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student, so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also.
Downfalls: sharp edges.
My kids have to take their PCs in once a year to have them "de-bugged".
All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro, it is clean and organized, which I always strive to be myself.
I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one, but IMO NO STARS
This computer gets very hot, before shutting down.
My son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind, and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school.
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.
I am very Happy!
It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time.
This is my first computer purchase
I was psyched.
The price is 200 dollars down.
  Problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school.
I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes.
Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model, which gets hot and the battery doesn't make it through 1 DVD.
It's fast and has excellent battery life.
A tip for people looking into this computer: DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last.
I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!
THEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went.
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs, but he thinks it is worth every penny.
I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter, so it's not just an isolated incident!!!
In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they "expedited" the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed, by a "Senior Tech".
COMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS.
I enjoy having apple products.
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset.
My house is now 100% Macbook.
I did not like my acer.
It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.
Took it back as it was defective.
It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling.
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling.
Bigger HD, better graphics card, and a bid HD.
PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote.
Overall, this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase!
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
We purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive HP needed to be repaired.
This laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials.
Hope this helped!
Since I have always used Apple products, the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious.
It's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc!
I had my computer custom built from Sonystyle.com.
Who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing?  So, I said I wanted a new set.
The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.
I tried several monitors and several HDMI cables and this was the case each time.
No waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state (or more often, another country).
The minute you fire it up it's all good, very easy user interface.
I have now had it for 1.5 months and love it.
Bought it to use mostly for oline classes.
Amazing Quality!
Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
also it is light weight compared to others.
Everything else just install and go.
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one.
It is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it!
It is everything that I would want in a computer.
I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great!
I love this program, it is superior to windows movie maker.
Summary: Dont buy HP.
-Touchpad will take a bit of time to get used to.
However, my girlfriend realized that the netbook's hinge is a bit loose (when you open or close the LCD).
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews, but I've found it fine to work with.
Granted, it's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops, my Mac boots up noticeably quicker.
The Toshiba laptop was a great purchase.
It played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly.
I left the place angrily.
All the above aside this machine ROCKS!
Plain and simple, it(laptop) runs great and loads fast.
My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance, picture quality, and ease of use.
(The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive.)
Enjoy your sitdown
I didn't like one thing about it.
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it.
Taking it anywhere was a pain!
I am very happy with my first Mac.
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny.
Stay away from Envy.
This computer is absolutely AMAZING!!!
For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop.
While lacking some of the functions of the other versions, this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer.
These new problems were the final straws;
LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!
I mainly use it for email, internet, and managing personal files (pics, vids, etc.).
I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times.
I paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen, as well as the top of the line DVD and CD burners.
Never been happier using  computer.
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!
The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.
Soft touch, anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws.
What I'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory.
Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.
Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on.
I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use, stylish, fun, awesome computer.
It is so much easier to use
Suffice it to say, my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed.
I love the operating system and the preloaded software.
And it is impossible to get them back in.
This laptop is insane!!!
If you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, just buy the case and be happy, plus it looks nice, I bought the white one from Best Buy.
I fell in love with my machine, and it was pampered.
Of course, I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others.
Everything about this computer is easy to use.
Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port, HDMI, ethernet and 3 USB ports.
Love it so far.
No tutorials on the display.
I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive.
This mac does come with an extender cable and I'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac.
The #1 reason that is always repeated.
The MAC Mini, wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done.
This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
I would not recommend this product to anyone.
I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office.
I just hope this expensive laptop doesn't go dead like my friends...it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust.
BUT there's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
Apparently they're not special anymore .
If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it!
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid.
Take the simple, easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around.
This computer was awful!
I love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it.
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance.
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.
This is the third MacBook Pro in our family.
Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba.
  It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium--delivered with only 1GB of RAM, and it was a *dog*.
Not worth it one bit.
We decided we would try to trade-in our old ones.
Oh, boy!
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it.
I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use.
Well, they don't care a bunch.
It really is very light compared to other computers.
It certainly does, but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac's complain about anything.
It's the most wonderful thing in the entire world.
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well, battery life AMAZING.
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.
I thought the price was great for the specs.
Better stick with another brand.
The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made.
I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.
HP refused to give me a new one and Wal Mart refused to take it back.
It's not a recommendation, it' a plea.
not something you want to miss out on!!!
I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.
It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax.
Apple did a great job.
It completely supports my home business and personal life.
I've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.
This laptop has left me with a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth for Acer brand products.
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.

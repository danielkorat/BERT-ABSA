I ca n't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print .
It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived .
This Macbook Pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .
This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .
One of the wonderful things about Macs is that they are virus free .
There are no gold key numbers too intall programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .
My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere .
I would recommend Mac , and do , to anyone looking to buy a new computer .
DEFINITELY recommended !!!
But guess what ? ( you have to buy an external dvd drive it does n't have a built in type ) The notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .
Pay attention to the specs if you want these options .
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .
Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming , as I have a desktop rig for that reason .
It has a lot of memory and a great battery life .
I 'm a professional consultant , and a client needed work on her machine .
I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME !
The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( I prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .
IT IS TRASH !
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it .
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop .
So , I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try .
Just do n't waste your time and money on this .
Added an iMac about 2 years later .
Set up was easy .
I am loving the fast performance also .
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .
Windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .
Of course , I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork , GarageBand , and iMovie .
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !
It was n't worth it .
I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home , and it runs just fine .
Despite the claims of the Apple apologists ( a vice of which I am recently myself reformed ) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs ' at this point .
The Toshiba Satellite laptop is DESIGNED to fail !
I shipped out on Saturday , July 17 .
Probbly the worst decision we ever made !
I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do , and I did n't know what to do ....
It is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .
However the frozen screens kept happening .
I Contacted HP about this situation and was given excuses , without results .
The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it !
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .
i cant believe HP put this out .
I love the operating system and the preloaded software .
I fell in love with it .
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .
The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue .
So you might ask , what did Apple do for me ?
? I am only interested in the 15.4 McBook Pro Model # MD103LL/A
I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try .
) I also purchased Applecare for $ 300 , which is a three year extended warranty , since I ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .
Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors !!!!
Even so , I like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows .
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage .
It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow .
I feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .
You can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .
But not in this case .
The screen is huge and coloful , but no LED backlighting .
! Excelent performance , usability , presentation and time response .
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .
It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit .
But sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because Im used to my Lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if I want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when I take photos and video .
Apparently they 're not special anymore .
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for .
It was at my door in less than 24 hours .
Very nice so far .
This laptop rocks ( only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple does n't support ) !
I ca n't honestly say I was heartbroken .
Not working = bad
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air .
/ awesome cooling system / much better grafics card ( ATI 5870 ) / 8GB RAM / LED backlit screen ...
THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT .
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .
I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen .
I had of course bought a 3 year warranty , so I sent it in to be replaced and ( almost 2 months later ) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement .
It did n't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it 's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .
Either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it .
The last new mac I bought was in 1998 .
* 3 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Visited MacHouse Amsterdam .
So glad I have gone this route !!
another problem .
BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART , I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM .
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .
AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !
It even has a great webcam , and Skype works very well .
The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones .
The 2 GB of RAM is plenty , able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown .
It Was a great deal after all .
I hate it .
Would like more trendy , high tech features .
They said it was a computer error on this type of computer .
The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel .
It is very well built .
I am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated .
he ca n't stand it .
what an elegant , wonderful machine .
for two months , when YOU GUESSED IT .
I could n't be more pleased .
Now , the next issue I had freaked me out .
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .
Some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains .
I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty .
My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .
Runs very smoothly .
Bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since " learning how to use it " .
Buy the Mac Mini it 's a terribly great machine .
The screen is a little glary , and I hated the clicking buttons , but I got used to them .
I ca n't even turn it off .
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
I 'm pretty sure when I bought it , my bank account went ' ouch !
It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere .
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming .
The bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .
Will certainly use MacConnection again .
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm .
Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac .
But I needed a laptop for school use .
They break down just as often as PCs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a Mac , they do n't exist .
Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .
Recommended to people as their first laptop .
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC .
But I was completely wrong , this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use .
Still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .
Have one myself and Love it !
And at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( I bought the memory stick they recomended ) .
However , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .
Never any doubt I would get a MacBook , just was n't sure which one .
I now travel with this laptop and my work PC .
On start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys ( but that was expected ) .
Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .
I decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for Xmas .
There is nothing to complain about the system .
If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .
The price is 200 dollars down .
DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE .
One bad thing is it gets hot .
Purchased as a gift for a friend .
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .
I 'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible .
When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great .
Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small .
I would recommend this product .
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up
Better stick with another brand .
I was originally concerned that I could n't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting , but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs .
This computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and I DO mean crawling .
This is the first Apple product that I have purchased .
Though you get a polite person , you often don t get a solution .
this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .
It 's also very pricey but you just have to tell yourself it 's an investment and that it 's gon na last you a long time .
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions .
Very disappointed !
If what you need is a machine to do some surfing , email checking , word processing , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !
This machine delivers .
I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .
The battery life is also relatively good .
Lastly , Windows 8 is annoying .
In those three years , I 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily .
My bag just got a little lighter .
So noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .
Not even safe mode boots .
The old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .
GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING !!!
I bought a cordless mouse for it , but do n't always take it out ;
This is an over-sized , 18-inch laptop .
As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .
So far , so good .
A * big * upgrade from my 13 " 2006 macbook .
This thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything I could ask for .
If you find yourself in the market for a new laptop ( and have the money ) do n't exclude looking at the MBPs .
Take the simple , easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around .
Mine came at $ 1,700 w/o a DVD burner ( ! ) .
First , you ll discover that the word processing program known as Appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all .
Lord HAVE MERCY !
I finally own a piece of computing equipment that I do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .
The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .
Just what the doctor ordered .
All the problems I have had with PC 's are solved with a Mac : the issue of overheating-my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .
Not too much " junk " software to remove .
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing ;
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .
The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .
I already own an iPhone , and so the move just made more sense .
it 's just a great toy to have around .
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .
The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to .
However , it did not have any scratches , ZERO battery cycle count ( pretty surprised ) , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .
It took so much time .
Bought with a credit card .
I would never buy a Dell again .
Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought .
The gray color was a good choice .
First it burned or fused the power adapter plug .
I just love my Mac !
That 's the downside for me .
I 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .
I had my computer custom built from Sonystyle.com .
Sure hope Best Buy will replace it asap .
) only to get another " HP/Compaq " piece of crap .
That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .
I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait .
Its everything mac offers .
All the above aside this machine ROCKS !
Still not bad for 220.00 .
Other than that I do n't have one complaint in the world !
Nothing about it that i do n't love , apple always makes a great product .
I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE .
Mac tutorials do help .
They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with .
I love the form factor .
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs .
That system is fixed .
It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop !
A couple things you should know :
But I do n't see it as a problem .
) And printing from either word processor is an adventure .
of course my warranty runs out next month .
I can actually get work done with this MAC , and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop .
I 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .
And it 's so quiet that I do n't hear it at all .
But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE ---- BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY .
We do n't Mind and You do n't Matter .
It 's light and easy to transport .
You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it .
I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion , so I kind of knew what I was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .
Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one .
They 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .
Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .
It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error .
With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must .
I bought it during the recent Comex IT show .
Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent .
It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .
3D rendering slows it down considerably .
Then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .
It will make life so much easier next semester , just wish I had it last semester !!
Amazing product as you would expect from Apple .
I 'm glad I bought this laptop , it was worth the few ( $ 100 ) extra dollars .
It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty .
The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( I even put it to the test by accident ) - excellent innovation !
It is very durable , I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .
I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it .
The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable .
The difference is phenomenal .
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out .
This computer had exactly the specifications I needed .
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty .
With today 's company fighting over marketshare , its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone .
If so , you may be having similar problems .
It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .
The price and features more than met my needs .
Asked the customer service rep.
It 's more expensive but well worth it in the long run .
Emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit .
I took it back for a full refund .
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .
THEN , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .
My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .
I would never tell anyone to buy one either .
No temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset " - Inquired status of repair .
The people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .
I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it .
I 'd recommend this laptop to anyone !
I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute .
Every time I log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through .
Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product .
Does exactly what I bought it 4 .
It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting .
When it broke I wanted another Acer and chose the V5 .
The book is useless .
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .
Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up !
Just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .
The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .
ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .
2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection .
I never tried any external mics with that iMac .
There are several programs for school or office use ( Pages , Numbers , Keynote , etc. ) , music ( Garageband ) , photo management ( Photo Booth , iPhoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( iMovie ) , etc .
But we had paid for bluetooth , and there was none .
You wo n't be disappointed .
We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well .
I would recommend not buying this product .
They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n't work .
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back .
Very light and easily maneuverable .
I brought this laptop last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .
It 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I 'm taking this year in college : - )
A tip for people looking into this computer : DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .
Got this Mac Mini with OS X Mountain Lion for my wife .
But , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .
I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem .
I am now making a point to avoid their products and I hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well .
The OS is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile .
Received all four in good order ;
It weighed like seven pounds or something like that .
The performance is awesome .
Maybe it 's Acer , maybe it 's MSFT .
I now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop .
i can use it for all of my needs .
My children wo n't even use it for their school work .
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .
The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the " repair " .
I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP , but I use the touchpad 90 % of the time .
Mac computers automatically " defrag " each time you start your computer .
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .
It still works and it 's extremely user friendly , so I would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers ) .
My husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .
We were PC users .
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .
after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak .
It is , however , very heavy .
Never been happier using computer .
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies .
( but Office can be purchased ) IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba !!
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .
Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .
10/10 five stars would recommend .
I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .
I mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files ( pics , vids , etc. ) .
What 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .
Even set at the highest level , the computer sacrifices its queen every time .
Besides the great look , it is a great machine .
Unfortunately , Apple 's quality has continued to slide .
I ca n't say enough good for it !
They do n't seem to be susceptible to viruses , which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers .
Not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .
I hope this review helps .
YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR .
The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer I have ever owned .
They said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not Sony itself anymore .
However , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .
Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .
I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP ( what I thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .
The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere .
My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen .
The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .
All I can say is I am impressed .
Yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .
It is quiet and a real joy to watch work .
To those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !
Laptop is to be used like a Netbook .
I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop .
I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed .
For those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;
compresses itself and you ca n't use it .
I thought it would be a simple job .
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .
$ 999.00 Tax free .
While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I 've used .
* 4 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to Apple .
So this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it .
This computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .
I like the brightness and adjustments .
The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did , and I have all of the programs that were on my PC .
It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .
The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time .
Do not purchase this laptop .
In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " Senior Tech " .
Good luck .
After using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .
You just can not beat the functionality of an Apple device .
It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine .
What can I say .
The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb .
Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer , so I had to remove it .
User friendly , fast and high tech It is amazing !
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .
Overall , it 's ok .
The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel .
Only a few days after I received the computer back , the screen froze again .
I use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP , well , I 'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone !
I use this for my tutoring business , and since I 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .
- Called MacHouse Amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .
The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed .
Summary : HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it .
WiFi capability , disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required .
The fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .
The Windows 7 Starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics .
See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .
It was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
defective software .
It 's now all commodity hardware .
Since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour ....
So , I went back .
Came fully loaded - good .
Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside .
The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord .
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent ...
" > iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with : easy and convenient .
If you have much higher expectations than that ... I would look elsewhere .
I eventually did the migration from my iMac backup disc which uses USB .
So far , I have no complaints .
Also , you wo n't have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus .
Anyway , in early July of this year , the DVD burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
It just works flawlessly !
My Toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .
Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the " human interface .
It doesnt work worth a damn .
I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .
I am ADDICTED to photo booth !
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .
I bought this one for my 11 year old and the MacBook Air for my 9 year old .
The display is beyond horrible .
It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted .
it is of high quality , has a killer GUI , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
Very very disappointed !
The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .
This was an update from an early MacBook Pro .
One drawback , I wish the keys were backlit .
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful , well worth it .
The graphics are stunning .
It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .
The graphics are great .
The exterior is absolutely gorgeous .
There has been no problem with anything .
Runs Hot I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product .
The troubleshooting said it was the AC adaptor so we ordered a new one .
while the keyboard itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .
But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .
It did not have all the features I expected it to have .
With what I do know how to do , the computer works beautiful .
Another included program that is laughable is the chess game .
Second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
This flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else Apple got right with the Mini .
At first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .
The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up .
It freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it .
i love ths notebook .
I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time .
I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .
When i finally held it in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .
The MAC Mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done .
I had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .
This computer was so challenging to carry and handle .
It 's annoying very much and I wo n't ever buy any Acer products .
It made the computer much easier to use and navigate .
Another Great thing is the Beast graphics .
I got a mac as my HS graduation gift .
The only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but I expected that .
Moral of the story : - Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .
I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to Microsoft Office ) .
The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .
On the twelfth day that I had the notebook , I decided to go to Dell 's website and update it .
The graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer .
I can do pretty much 75 % of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table .
It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied .
I like coming back to Mac OS but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old HP laptop .
The screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .
I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY COLLEGE AGE GRANDCHILDREN AND THESE MACS ARE TOTALLY RELIABLE AND SUPPORT THEIR CLASS WORK 100 % OF THE TIME .
Took that one home , same thing .
Fan only comes on when you are playing a game .
Took it back as it was defective .
I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac .
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !
It is easy to navigate and update programs .
Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative .
The computer would not ever cut back on .
The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !
I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products .
Dells are ok , HPs are n't that good , but Macs or Fantastic .
I will not be using that slot again .
Great OS , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port .
He 's thrilled with his new laptop .
The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !
I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one .
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint .
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid .
That includes transferring my music and movies .
It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive .
I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls .
It bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic Chrome .
I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours .
previous laptops were pc 's , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system .
In short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing Rover your dog ) .
His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test , and it was failing .
- Touchpad will take a bit of time to get used to .
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .
My kids ( and dogs ) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them .
It was a laugh too !
I like iTunes , the apparent security , the Mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .
And windows 7 works like a charm .
It 's a nice little gadget .
Could n't keep a page up you were working on !
and the speakers is the worst ever .
I paid about the same for my Toshiba as I did for the compaq a few years back .
breaks easily .
You will need them if you want to reload the OS ( I recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal ) .
Many thanks , Overstock.com .
If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .
That 's a huge difference .
Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer .
My one complaint is that there was no internal CD drive .
HP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC When I first got this computer , it really rocked .
The price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac .
I can not be happier with the service or product .
The screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV .
After 2 months of complaints , Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies .
It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made .
The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .
I will only buy apple laptops from now on .
By the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66 GHz 15 " Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .
The only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .
Nothing wrong with this computer at all !
3 ) Horrible customer support
So it was only about 2 weeks ago .
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
Seems to me that 's the best way to get Apple 's attention .
English must have been his third or fourth language .
But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .
do not buy you will be disappointed .
Mom , Dad , Brother , sister , You name it !
It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact , and I am certainly glad I did .
No Viruses !
The " Time remaining " goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .
I love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it .
I go to purchase it on line , and I find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .
I 've never had problems with viruses .
After doing CAD work all day at work , using a higher end PC , I could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .
Apple did a great job .
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem .
I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I ca n't imagine ever going back .
Just a black screen !
Great wifi too .
I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it .
Not good for a person who gets online daily .
might have to buy one for me now , since I use it all the time .
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
It is easy to use , good quality and good price .
A MONTH LATER , we reinstall the OS ( Vista ) .
It is held in place magnetically .
I was very worried about making the two compatible - but literally , it was so simple I was almost worried that I was doing something wrong .
They are closed at 9pm eastern .
The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV .
It is easy to use , has great screen quality , and every so light weight .
Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .
I like the lighted screen at night .
It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home .
It 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .
This is a great value for the money .
Or the cursor would show up some place else .
" For one , I noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds .
Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .
Before I got my macbook , I owned a Dell laptop .
I also made a recovery USB stick .
User upgradeable RAM and HDD .
Trashed it when I spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .
The machine is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .
Once you go Mac , you ca n't go back !
But , Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy .
This computer is absolutely AMAZING !!!
Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .
mac is extremely different than any other laptop .
pros : the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .
They do n't crash .
Asus facial recognition does n't work and windows logon is n't either .
The speed , the simplicity , the design . . it is lightyears ahead of any PC I have ever owned .
Finally , I purchased a Toshiba .
This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter .
You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever .
Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba .
Connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all .
It has happened again and I 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .
It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it 's a snap .
HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP , I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS .
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .
Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .
The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command prompt would not work at all .
I expected so as it 's an Apple product , but I was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is THE laptop to buy right now .
I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !
I took it in to the Apple store and guess what ? They fixed it , no cost out of pocket .
MAYBE The Mac OS improvement were not The product they Want to offer .
I love the easy to see screen , and It works well for work , persoal or just play .
Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarentee .
This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone .
She brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " It is like that one " .
I had the same reasons as most PC users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .
It is small enough to fit in one of my purses !
I shopped around before buying .
Good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7 .
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .
The screen is gorgeous - yummy good .
It is a bit heavy .
I 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .
There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac , which saves me a lot of time and money .
The smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .
Overall , this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase !
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba .
My last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine .
Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery .
The laptop is gorgeous .
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .
It works fine with our wireless and they 've had not problems .
We were occasional Mac users before , but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford .
I WANT MY L505-s5988 BACK !
tons of bloatware and junk programs .
So what am I supposed to do ? The LG service center can not provide me the " service " when it is called the " service center " .
The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased .
I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved .
Very Very Highly Recommended .
I ca n't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket .
But reasons we chose this Apple computer .
I was having a though time deciding between the 13 " MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro 13 " ( Both baseline models , priced at 1,200 $ retail )
Have used only Macs for years .
The acer one compuer is a great computer .
So this was great for me .
I am stuck with a laptop that I can not do very much with .
Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems , as well .
Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop .
No Cd Rom in the new version there 's no way I 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .
This time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !
I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one .
I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSE N'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
It is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .
No big deal .
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .
Avoid this model .
I 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it .
It is fast and easy to use .
Otherwise , I love it !
When I turned it on , nothing .
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point .
Best Buy laughed when I told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .
Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP .
I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon did n't have it yet .
It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours .
returned it .
Still under warrenty so called Toshiba , no help at all .
Of course , I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others .
I loved the netbook ( minus the fact that it was windows OS ) until this started happening .
The sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .
Two times with in one month .
Honestly , I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .
I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it .
Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .
If that is the case for you , I would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .
I am a full Mac convert now .
The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior .
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !
I am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .
At first , I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the Mac system .
Probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .
- Called headquarters again , they report that TFT panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week ( week 3 ) .
It 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
Needs constant repair .
The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .
Called Acer many times , they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center - I was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .
I am not much of a computer techie , so I can understand some of the internal problems , though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program .
If the number of patrons in the Apple store are any indication , HP and other PC manufacturers need to take note .
Before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .
I would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend .
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .
It has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on .
After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .
I love the 15 " MacBook Pro .
It is super fast , and always loads .
Do n't waste their money , save it and but a mac .
No HDMI port .
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIFIC !!
Best commuter I have ever owned .
Yes , he is a self professed " Mac snob .
Good computer and fast .
Took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different FedEx offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world .
Now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .
I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .
It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was .
I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .
I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I 've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb , 201
super fast processor and really nice graphics card . .
The technical support was not helpful as well .
I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky !!
We have had numerous problems with Vista , such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update .
I 'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes .
I love its solid build , light wt and excellent battery life ( for now ) .
The battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba .
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future .
But let me tell you , the mac book pro is so professional .
I 'm just really happy that I waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !
It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat .
I 'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfect . . i It is !!
It ca n't get any better .
Overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
The only downfall is the volume control .
Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best !
I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair .
I do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and I 'll never buy another one because I 've put more into it then it is worth .
The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .
So think about factoring those things in when you purchase .
This worked just fine .
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .
My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .
Until I bought the Dell , I thought you just looked for what you wanted ( size , software , options , hardware ) and purchase the best deal you could find .
Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem , they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I 'd like to purchase more memory for $ 75 .
The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance .
It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .
Extremely disappointed with the way it is .
Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .
The Macbooks worth every penny .
In the three years I 've had my MacBook Pro , I have never had a virus on my computer , and I do a lot of work on the internet .
So happy with this purchase , I just wish it came with Microsoft Word .
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again .
The processor screams , and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software .
Thank God for " ctrl Z " Bottom line , I 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .
The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !
The battery has never worked well .
I actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd drive twice , then they FINALLY agreed to replace it , ( ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS !
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC 's require .
Why not 5 stars ?
From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .
Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP .
Do I like the computer ? Well , other than not getting viruses , I guess it is OK .
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .
It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not .
The first programm I switched on was a game for my children .
The leather carrying case , keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from Memphis warehouse .
NO good .
The speakers on it are useless too .
Quietest laptop I have ever owned .
It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium -- delivered with only 1GB of RAM , and it was a * dog * .
This is by far thee best , most reliable computer I could find .
I just ca n't fathom that the celebrated Dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .
At $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .
this computer will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life spanned an electronic .
No I am generous calling it slow .
This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone .
I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
it was a tough choice .
Have purchased many products over the years from MacConnection and this transaction , like all the others , we smoothly with no problems .
The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade .
To my mind much more usable than the toy called an IPad .
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what I 've done .
The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .
I was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates .
It is SO much fun to play with .
The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .
I have recently converted back to a mac and I could n't be happier !
Not to mention it has shit gigs .
and finally i realized that mac is the best .
it is the worst computer dell ever made .
Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .
Hieroglyphics are quite common .
One year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it .
Great product .
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life AMAZING .
It works really well .
Applications open in seconds and there are no lags , hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea .
I have had some excellent computer and have found I had no idea what to do with them
! so nice . . stable . . fast . . now i got my SSD !
If you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .
The machine is speedy and efficient .
Would do business again .
Very annoying .
Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints .
After purchasing this thing , I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .
Was skeptical about buying an electronic item online but it turned out to be a positive experience .
I am very Happy !
For me , five stars is not enough .
This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old .
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .
Perfect trifecta !
Get this instead , you wo n't be sorry .
The design is awesome , quality is unprecedented .
So this review might be a tad bit bias .
Has a 5-6 hour battery life .
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .
This laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
This laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery I have owned outside of the Iphone .
All in all , a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service .
I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection .
Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds .
I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town .
Ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple .
Deal of the year .
return it .
I 've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret buying it .
This item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro !
Was not happy with one of the programs on it .
The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .
It is not ideal for children because of the temp .
its not bad just VERY VERY annoying .
Being a tech savvy , APPLE - product loving person , I 'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro !
In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced .
Satisfy what I paid for it .
Runs smooth and quick .
The " abuse " is that I pushed the power plug in too hard .
I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .
But for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the PC 's this is a good foot in the door into mac .
upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told , was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired .
It 's face and depanable .
After fumbling around with the OS I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .
PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote .
I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6 " .
There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark .
i 'm returning mine
After numerous attempts of trying ( including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly ) , I gave up ( I am a techie ) .
The image is great , and the soud is excelent .
I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .
I am replacing the HD with a Micron SSD soon .
but in resume this computer rocks !
However , If I sound enthusiastic about this , I am !
Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .
Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund .
Bought this gateway M-50 or 150 early 2007 .
I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college .
I 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and Apple does , indeed , have the better idea .
The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .
but other then that I would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .
I asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .
All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .
I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .
The programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .
i had to return it for a replacement .
If you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 model , you should wait until the next update .
The feature are good enough for what I need .
The next time I had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .
I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .
The SD card reader is slightly recessed and upside down ( the nail slot on the card can not be accessed ) , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .
Now , as easy as it is to use , and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop .
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini .
The Macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .
One more tip , please purchase this model and get a 4GB stick of RAM to save you $ 10
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you 're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I 've never used a computer that performs better .
10 plus hours of battery ...
For the same price , you get a lot more in the Asus .... 1920x1080 res .
I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba !
They replaced it and so far so good .
However , a NETBOOK will be a different story .
Well , I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC , but took the Apple to the conference .
I am just ONE of the million customers .
Plain and simple , it ( laptop ) runs great and loads fast .
However , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) .
From the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple .
All you have to do is turn it on and it works .
Called tech support and got the usual Acer " We do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you " I explained there was no software involved in booting .
HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK !!!
This is the first macbook I have ever had .
And Toshiba is a quality supplier .
I guess he was the technical person .
Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name .
Shipped very quickly and safely .
I also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull .
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications .
I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from !
It is so much easier to use
I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use .
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage .
I also wanted Windows 7 , which this one has .
All of them were Windows machines .
In addition , all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .
Theres also iDVD , a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together - photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .
It 's just what we were looking for and it works great .
Buy it , love it , and I promise you wo n't regret it .
Even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .
I would suggest this product to anyone .
I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused .
I took the laptop home and not even a month later , I began to have problems with it .
But enough about that , I am an Apple convert for life .
About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro , which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro .
This computer is really fast and I 'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to ...
I had gotten this model for $ 1199.00 on my State 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a MacBook at the local BestBuy !
Supplied software : The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with .
I waited and waited and no laptop .
I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro .
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled .
You will fall in love with it in no time .
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop !
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and gaming .
I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed .
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is , I never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but I did .
Finally , I should note that I took the 2GB RAM stick from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time .
My problem was with DELL Customer Service .
Also is portable and reliable .
Excellent LED monitor and well equipped .
Enjoy using Microsoft Office !
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7 .
Great laptop that offers many great features !
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it would n't have ANY problems .
In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
I also love the small , convenient size of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .
Good laptop for the money .
I had my IWORKS , Itunes , Email , MS Office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .
I hate it !
Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini .
My HP is very heavy .
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .
I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop .
This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised .
Do n't get me wrong , I am no Microsoft hater , I 've just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine .
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?
Did I mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK ?
I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one .
I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .
Newegg 's RMA service was great as always , I contacted them late Friday night , and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday .
Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed .
WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER -------- LOU
It 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .
A great feature is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .
I am still in the process of learning about its features .
The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .
Even though it is much more expensive than many PC laptops , it is worth the price .
Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII .
I have a lapdesk which I can use , but I can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .
2 . The wireless card is low quality .
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13.3 MacBook Pro Model # MD101LL/A .
It works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .
I was so excited to get this in the mail i nearly gave myself a heart attack .
Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .
My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates .
Posted Nov 8 , 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook .
I 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .
In my line of work , I often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .
Other ports include FireWire 800 , Gigabit Ethernet , MagSafe port , Microphone jack .
If you do n't like fingerprints , this might not be the laptop for you .

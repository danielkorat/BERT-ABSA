sony,,,,"But <span class=""AS"">Sony</span> said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.","As I soon discovered, though, there is a reason for which similarly-configured <span class=""AS"">Sony</span> and Toshiba machines cost more: they use higher-quality components that are faster, better-configured, and end up lasting a lot longer.","They sent out a <span class=""AS"">Sony</span> 'Certified' technician.","I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC (a <span class=""AS"">Sony</span> Vaio), but it was basically no better than my old PC, so I returned it.","I can't even remember how I finally got it taken care of, but I was done with <span class=""AS"">Sony</span> after that!","Looked at HP, ASUS, Acer, <span class=""AS"">Sony</span> and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked.","My opinion of <span class=""AS"">Sony</span> has been dropping as fast as the stock market, given their horrible support, but this machine just caused another plunge.","That included the extra <span class=""AS"">Sony</span> Sonic Stage software, the speakers and the subwoofer I got (that WAS worth the money), the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer, the extended life battery and the Docking port."
construction,,,,"The Unibody <span class=""AS"">construction</span> is solid, sleek and beautiful.","Yes, they cost more, but they more than make up for it in speed, <span class=""AS"">construction</span> quality, and longevity.","It is made of such solid <span class=""AS"">construction</span> and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit.","The unibody <span class=""AS"">construction</span> really does feel lot more solid than Apple's previous laptops.","The cover for the DVD drive soon came off, too--a mark of poor <span class=""AS"">construction</span> quality."

tech support,,,,"When you call <span class=""AS"">tech support</span> you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing.","But the biggest pain is that <span class=""AS"">tech support</span> is not available 24/7.","I agree with the previous comment that ASUS <span class=""AS"">TECH SUPPORT</span> IS HORRIBLE","I understand I should call Apple <span class=""AS"">Tech Support</span> about any variables(which is my purpose of writing this con) as variables could be a bigger future problem.","It took Toshiba <span class=""AS"">tech support</span> 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.","Ive had to call <span class=""AS"">tech support</span> many times.","I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for <span class=""AS"">tech support</span> and had to result the their online chat."

processor,,,,"The AMD Turin <span class=""AS"">processor</span> seems to always perform so much better than Intel.","It has a faster <span class=""AS"">processor</span> and more ram.","My only disappointment with the 13"" model is that they're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 <span class=""AS"">processor</span> and dual graphics cards, however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life (of about 2 more hours).","The <span class=""AS"">processor</span> a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.","The <span class=""AS"">processor</span> went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.","Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word <span class=""AS"">processor</span> (such as works for windows), but iwork is cheap compared to office.","The <span class=""AS"">processor</span> is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.","the i3 <span class=""AS"">processor</span> doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on."

computer experience,,,,"I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards, but this is the worst <span class=""AS"">computer experience</span> that I have ever had."
decision,,,,"Instead, I'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated <span class=""AS"">decision</span> on which Mac to buy.","It was a hard <span class=""AS"">decision</span> for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing.","I think that was a great <span class=""AS"">decision</span> to buy"

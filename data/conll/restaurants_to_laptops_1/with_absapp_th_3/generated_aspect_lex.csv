bunch,,,,"The cool thing about the Mac Book was that I went on my honeymoon and shot a <span class=""AS"">bunch</span> of pictures and movies with my iPhone, then I came back and put them onto my Macbook and made a pretty good DVD movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip.","I had to go through a <span class=""AS"">bunch</span> of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.","So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a <span class=""AS"">bunch</span> of people you cant understand.","Just a <span class=""AS"">bunch</span> of idiots who's English as a 5th language is forced at best.","Looked at HP, ASUS, Acer, Sony and a <span class=""AS"">bunch</span> of other ones but could not find I really liked."
dell laptop,,,,"I previously owned an older <span class=""AS"">Dell laptop</span> that died after about 5 or 6 years.","I had in the past a <span class=""AS"">Dell laptop</span> and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it."
weight,,,,"Of course, for a student, <span class=""AS"">weight</span> is always an issue.","It is easy to use, its keyboard easily accommodates large hands, and its <span class=""AS"">weight</span> is fantasic.","also it is light <span class=""AS"">weight</span> compared to others.","also...- excellent operating system- size and <span class=""AS"">weight</span> for optimal mobility- excellent durability of the battery-","I dislike the <span class=""AS"">weight</span> and size, cubersome.","Right size and <span class=""AS"">weight</span> for portability."
side,,,,"I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them <span class=""AS"">side</span> by side with the same dvd in (battle of the Smithsonian)","So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their <span class=""AS"">side</span> , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).","If you start on the far right <span class=""AS"">side</span> and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up.","on the bright <span class=""AS"">side</span> at least I wasn't without my laptop for long this time!","the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the <span class=""AS"">side</span> which I am used to it being on the side.","The one down <span class=""AS"">side</span> to it is that when I play a certin game on here, it tends to freeze up sometimes, but thats the only bad thing about this computer.","The 4 USB ports are nice, but the two on the <span class=""AS"">side</span> only work now and then."
decision,,,,"Instead, I'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated <span class=""AS"">decision</span> on which Mac to buy.","It was a hard <span class=""AS"">decision</span> for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing.","I think that was a great <span class=""AS"">decision</span> to buy"
investment,,,,"The <span class=""AS"">investment</span> of a new MacBook Pro came at a price, but totally worth it for a good piece of mind.","The apple MacBook is the best <span class=""AS"">investment</span> that I have ever made.","My MacBook is probably the best <span class=""AS"">investment</span> I have ever made.","Worth the <span class=""AS"">investment</span> and truly a fine piece of equipment."
opinion,,,,"In my <span class=""AS"">opinion</span> it was not as user friendly as I expected either.","My <span class=""AS"">opinion</span> of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market, given their horrible support, but this machine just caused another plunge.","so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my <span class=""AS"">opinion</span> you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop."
equipment,,,,"To be honest i think it was faulty <span class=""AS"">equipment</span> or something","without having to have extra <span class=""AS"">equipment</span> and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so."
operation,,,,"For some odd reasons the computer doesn't reconize the <span class=""AS"">operation</span> system.","I've lived with the crashes and slow <span class=""AS"">operation</span> and restarts."
user interface,,,,"The operating system and <span class=""AS"">user interface</span> is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing."

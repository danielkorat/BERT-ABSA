One	O
of	O
the	O

that	O

the	O

then	O
things	B-ASP
are	O
limited	O

My	O

it	O

The	O

a	O

such	O

at	O
a	O

price	B-ASP

I	O
'm	O
pretty	O
sure	O
when	O

the	O

is	O
absolutely	O
amazing	O

The	O

and	O
the	O
only	O
reason	B-ASP
they	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O

is	O
because	O
no	O

they	O
're	O
not	O

A	O
tip	O
for	O
people	O
looking	O
into	O
this	O
computer	O
:	O

DO	O
NOT	O
BUY	O

IT	O
save	O
up	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
money	O
and	O
buy	O
a	O
computer	O
that	O
will	O

Got	O
this	O

But	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
they	O
(	O
the	O
company	O
)	O
would	O
not	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
anything	B-ASP
about	O
my	O
problem	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
no	O
luck	O
with	O
staples	O
or	O
HP	B-ASP
to	O
resolve	O
this	O
problem	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
now	O
making	O
a	O
point	O
to	O
avoid	O
their	O
products	O

and	O
I	O
hope	O
my	O
experience	B-ASP
can	O
serve	O
as	O
a	O
warning	O
to	O
you	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

The	O
OS	O

fast	O

everything	B-ASP

My	O
favorite	O
part	B-ASP

I	O

Yes	O

that	O

that	O

THAT	O

THE	O
TOSHIBA	O

LAPTOP	B-ASP
HAS	O
MAJOR	O
PROBLEMS	O

I	O
spent	O
alot	B-ASP
of	O
money	O
on	O
this	O
product	B-ASP
and	O
its	O
been	O
a	O
nightmare	O
.	O

Your	O
cursor	O
will	O
end	O
up	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
freaking	O
place,,,it	O
's	O
not	O
uncommon	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
accidentally	O
delete	O
words	O
,	O
sentences	O
,	O
paragraphs	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
mousepad	O

The	O
internet	B-ASP
was	O
locekd	O
and	O
froze	O
every	O
time	B-ASP
it	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
be	O
used	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
command	O

would	O
not	O
work	O
at	O
all	O

I	O
expected	O
so	O
as	O
it	O
's	O
an	O
Apple	O
product	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
glad	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
expectations	O
exceeded	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
THE	O
laptop	B-ASP
to	O
buy	B-ASP
right	O
now	O
.	O

I	O
especially	O
appreciate	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
has	O
almost	O
zero	O
viruses	O
and	O
spyware	O
problems	O
!	O

I	O
took	O
it	O
in	O
to	O
the	O
Apple	O
store	O
and	O
guess	O
what	O
?	O

They	O
fixed	O
it	O
,	O
no	O
cost	O
out	O

MAYBE	O

The	O
Mac	B-ASP
OS	O
improvement	O
were	O
not	O
The	O

Want	O
to	O

I	O
love	O
the	O
easy	O

and	O
It	O
works	O
well	O
for	O
work	O

persoal	O
or	O
just	O

Some	O
problems	O
can	O
be	O

if	O
you	O
purchase	O
new	O
software	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
guarentee	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
laptop	B-ASP
and	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
it	O
to	O
anyone	B-ASP

She	O
brought	O
out	O
2	O

that	O
"	O
It	O
is	O

that	O
one	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
reasons	O
as	O
most	O
PC	O
users	O
:	O
the	O
price	B-ASP
,	O
the	O
overbearing	O
restrictions	O
of	O

and	O
lack	O
of	O
support	O
for	O
games	B-ASP

It	O
is	O
small	O
enough	O
to	O
fit	O
in	O
one	O

Everything	B-ASP

It	O

I	O
'm	O
really	O
impressed	O
with	O
the	O
quality	B-ASP
and	O
performance	B-ASP
for	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
the	O

There	O
is	O
no	O

to	O
purchase	O

which	O
saves	O
me	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
and	O

.	O

The	O
smaller	O
size	B-ASP
was	O
a	O
bonus	O
because	O
of	O
space	O

Overall	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
wonderful	O
computer	B-ASP
and	O
definitly	O
worth	O
the	O
purchase	O

Very	O

this	O

great	O
for	O

I	O

How	O

some	O

the	O

that	O

took	O
off	O

has	O
a	O

would	O

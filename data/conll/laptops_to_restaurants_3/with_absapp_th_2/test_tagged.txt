The	O
best	O
part	B-ASP
of	O
the	O
experience	B-ASP
was	O
knowing	O
that	O
the	O

,	O
the	O

My	O
GF	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
choose	O
to	O
eat	O
there	O
a	O
lot	O
because	O
of	O
diverse	O
cocktails	O
,	O
the	O
chill	O
decor	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
the	O
decent	O
sushi	B-ASP

Much	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
care	O
about	O
you	O

The	O
filet	O

dish	B-ASP
was	O
superb	O
!	O

I	O
've	O
had	O
the	O

at	O
Chennai	O
a	O

when	O
I	O

Their	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-ASP
is	O
n't	O
the	O
greatest	O

but	O
I	O
suppose	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
they	O
keep	O
the	O

i	O
have	O
eaten	O

for	O
no	O

besides	O

I	O
ate	O
here	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
found	B-ASP
most	O
dishes	O
average	O
at	O
best	O
and	O
too	O
expensive	O

Immediately	O
after	O
we	O

Furthermore	O

the	O

Good	O

because	O
hey	O
,	O
it	O

bad	O
because	O
dim	O
sum	B-ASP

so	O
you	O

the	O

The	O

I	O
wish	O

would	O
get	O
some	O

because	O
despite	O
the	O

I	O
was	O

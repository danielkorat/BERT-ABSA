I	O
have	O

I	O
finally	O
made	O

after	O
my	O

crapped	O
out	O

I	O
am	O
not	O

I	O
had	O
gotten	O
this	O

for	O
$	O
1199.00	O
on	O
my	O
State	O

at	O
the	O

So	O
I	O
called	O

and	O
after	O
being	O
on	O
the	O

for	O
3	O
hours	O
,	O
i	O
finally	O
got	O
a	O

I	O

This	O
can	O

at	O

you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O

yourself	O

I	O

Overall	O
for	O

this	O

I	O

It	O
's	O
priced	B-ASP
very	O
reasonable	O
and	O
works	B-ASP
very	O
well	O
right	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
box	O

The	O
iLife	B-ASP
software	I-ASP
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O
computer	O
is	O
so	O
simple	O
to	O
use	B-ASP
and	O
produces	O
a	O
great	O
finished	O
product	O
.	O

The	O
newer	O
MacBook	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
purchased	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
computers	O
.	O

THIS	O
is	O
what	O
a	O
laptop	O
is	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
.	O

One	O
drawback	O
,	O
I	O
wish	O
the	O
keys	B-ASP
were	O
backlit	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
get	O
Apple	B-ASP
Customer	I-ASP
Support	I-ASP
to	O
correct	O
the	O
problem	O
.	O

It	O
still	O
works	B-ASP
and	O
it	O
's	O
extremely	O
user	O
friendly	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
it	O
for	O
new	O
computer	O
user	O
and	O
also	O
for	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
just	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
more	O
efficient	O
way	O
to	O
do	O
things	O

The	O
machine	O
has	O
a	O
bluray	B-ASP
player	I-ASP
the	O
book	B-ASP
has	O
no	O
mention	O
of	O
it	O
or	O
how	O
to	O
connect	O
it	O
to	O
your	O
HDTV	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
for	O
sure	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
much	O
higher	O
expectations	O
than	O
that	O
...	O
I	O
would	O
look	O
elsewhere	O
.	O

The	O
screen	B-ASP
is	O
nice	O
and	O
the	O
images	O
comes	O
very	O
clear	O
,	O
the	O
keyboard	B-ASP
and	O
the	O
fit	B-ASP
just	O
feels	O
right	O
.	O

Overall	O
it	O
's	O
an	O
amazing	O
product	O
,	O
5	O
stars	O

i	O
asked	O
many	O

search	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
also	O
read	O
reviews	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
easy	O
decision	O
to	O
purchase	O
a	O
used	O
or	O
even	O
good	O
as	O
new	O

but	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
satisfied	O

Was	O
this	O

my	O

and	O
I	O
really	O
honestly	O

it	O

It	O
is	O
EXTREMELY	O
fast	O
and	O
never	O
lags	O

This	O
mac	O

My	O
one	O
complaint	O
is	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
internal	B-ASP
CD	I-ASP
drive	I-ASP
.	O

They	O
really	O
screwed	O
the	O
pooch	O
on	O
this	O
one	O
.	O

It	O
certainly	O
does	O
,	O
but	O
you	O
rarely	O
hear	O
any	O
of	O
your	O
friends	O
with	O
Mac	O
's	O
complain	O
about	O
anything	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
machine	O
!	O

I	O
'm	O
the	O
pro-active	O
type	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
and	O
did	O
some	O
preventative	O
fixes	O
.	O

It	O
came	O
before	O
the	O
day	O
it	O
supposed	O
to	O
which	O
is	O
great	O

Finally	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
n't	O
take	O
it	O
anymore	O
and	O
ordered	O
my	O
Apple	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
n't	O
afford	O
a	O
new	O
mac	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
bought	O
a	O

instead	O

If	O
you	O

this	O

I	O
'm	O
a	O

-	O
I	O
propose	O
that	O
they	O

just	O

Yes	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
expese	B-ASP
was	O
a	O
little	O
much	O

but	O
I	O
now	O
realize	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O

When	O
I	O
got	O
my	O

back	O
after	O
this	O
first	O

it	O
worked	O
okay	O
for	O
a	O
little	O

then	O
I	O
started	O
expeirencing	O
issues	O
again	O
,	O
everything	O
from	O

failing	O
again	O

all	O

of	O

Plus	O
it	O

I	O
love	O
everything	O
about	O
it	O

It	O
has	O
enough	O
memory	B-ASP

speed	B-ASP
to	O
run	O
my	O
business	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
flexibility	B-ASP
that	O
comes	O
with	O
a	O
laptop	O

And	O
that	O
probably	O
explains	O
why	O
I	O
've	O
already	O
had	O
my	O
SATA	B-ASP

go	O
bad	O
within	O
a	O

glad	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

The	O

I	O

Everything	O

just	O

My	O

it	O

I	O

complaint	O
is	O
that	O

This	O

my	O

modern	O
Japanese	O
brasserie	O
(	O
that	O
do	O

serve	O
sushi	B-ASP
)	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
romantic	O
restaurants	B-ASP
in	O
the	O
city	B-ASP
!	O

Try	O
green	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
,	O
drinks	B-ASP
and	O
service	B-ASP
are	O
clearly	O
among	O
the	O
best	O
in	O
the	O
city	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
so	O
cheap	O
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-ASP
are	O
nice	O

I	O
never	O
had	O
anything	B-ASP
I	O
did	O
n't	O

If	O
you	O

you	O
may	O
encounter	O
problems	O
ordering	B-ASP

be	O
sure	O
to	O
bring	O
plenty	O

cash	O
with	O
you	O

What	O

the	O

very	O

the	O

From	O

amazingly	O

You	O
ca	O
n't	O
say	O
its	O
cheap	O
because	O

cheaper	O
in	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
spot	B-ASP
if	O
it	O
were	O
not	O
so	O

The	O
service	B-ASP

the	O
only	O
thing	B-ASP

Whether	O

We	O
waited	O
at	O
the	O

had	O
martinis	O
that	O

I	O

sat	O
at	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O

The	O
whole	O

I	O
wish	O

would	O
get	O
some	O
good	O

,	O
because	O
despite	O
the	O

So	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
reviews	B-ASP
here	O
are	O
accurate	O
about	O
the	O

The	O

but	O
they	O
REALLY	O
need	B-ASP

its	O
quite	O

kills	O
your	O

to	O
make	O
this	O

look	B-ASP

Was	O
surprisingly	O
disappointed	O

At	O
this	O
point	O

the	O

comes	O
over	O
and	O
asks	O
us	O
if	O
everything	B-ASP
was	O
okay	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
literally	O
so	O
shocked	O
that	O
I	O
was	O

say	O
anything	O

the	O

WALKED	O
away	O

With	O
the	O

it	O
that	O
our	O

the	O

The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .
Also , the chick peas with shrimp ( appetizer ) is divine .
Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !
My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails , the chill decor , and the decent sushi .
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
The filet mignon dish was superb !
I 've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .
What I did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered .
Great restaurant , and even greater food !
We had reservations at 9pm , but was not seated until 10:15 pm .
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I 've had .
Went to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night .
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .
It is about FOOD and Ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .
The food is great .
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area .
There is " Expensive-but-worth-it " and there is " Expensive-and-WTF " ?
We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some food ?
The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food , the line reached the door .
my picks are : - Scallion Pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style ( one of my personal favorites ) - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish ( this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .
Dieters stick to salads or indulge in vegetarian platters .
You will find yourself returning quite often .
Behind this counter , two men are squeezed in .
We will go back every time we are in the City .
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .
SO GOOD
The pizza is overpriced and soggy .
If you go , try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm .... . everything is just delicious .
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this was n't a place we 'd return to .
If you were there when it first opened , give this restaurant a second chance .
What a great place .
Having discovered Ping 's on the internet , we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in .
The service was attentive .
Have the iced tea .
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not ( like the steak dish which tends to be dry ) .
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here .
The guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .
The service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
We 've always gotten amazing service and we love the food .
mojitos and the service are the best part in there
After a seafood craving , i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info .
The well mannered , pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ .
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious !
We will definitely go back .
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .
Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .
. the best I 've found outside of the Chinatown masters .
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place !
The fried dumplings are GREAT !
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .
Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !
It 's all about the food !!
Went for a late weekday lunch .
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good .
Ahhh ...
The Deco and ambiance was really romantic .
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady .
The best pad thai i 've ever had .
Try sushimi cucumber roll .
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the bagles are unbeliavably good .
I did n't take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic .
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .
Go girls !!!
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
The crispy chicken was n't for us , though .
Highly recommended to all !
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
I 'm going back .
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
I 've been to this monster sushi twice , the 46th st once , the 23rd st one a number of times .
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .
The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .
You should pass on the calamari .
I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant .
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute .
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now , its official !
I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
The decor is designed in a contemporary Japanese style restaurant .
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .
I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else .
we spent 50 $ $ definetly will come back with my friends !!!
I have been going back again and again .
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
We a menu that rearely changes , e xcept for one or two specials , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident .
I will definetly be going back .
I was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .
This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix .
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else .
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig !
The stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .
If you want to dine with large party , I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT .
A nice space , as long as it does n't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers .
But the coconut rice was good .
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
Gross food â€“ Wow -
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City .
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .
While their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .
Overall , I 'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its Chinatown .
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .
Decent wine at reasonable prices .
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .
The wine list is extensive , well priced and covers alot of regions .
The sushi is amazing !!!
The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate .
Do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door .
This is my fourth try over a two year period , and I 'm done .
It is bland and nothing extrodinary .
Well , it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks , and then tells us to chill out .
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions .
I 'm saving up for my next visit .
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I 've ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizza 's .
There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .
I grew up on these bagels .
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
There are other people waiting !
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged .
The place is beautiful !
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !
I 'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu !
So , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it .
Great pizza for lunch place .
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .
We 've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .
Sure , the setting is nice .
She replied " well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . "
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it .
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
The restaurant was quiet and intimate .
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here .
The food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used .
A small , outdoor eating area makes for a private , comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !
We could not catch our waiter 's eye , and he ignored us .
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .
The only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable .
This is one of my favorite spot , very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized .
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though - too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick .
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !
Definately check it out !!!
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications .
They were dry , stale and pretty flavorless .
Service was on par but not wonderful .
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
-- Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons
Two words : Free wine .
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection .
If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY .
Do n't go with a larger group than 4 !
Great vibe , lots of people .
Love Al Di La
Also get the Onion Rings -- best we 've ever had .
Tables are close , so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons .
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .
The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!
The food was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable .
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .
LOL
We wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .
Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy .
I thought the food is n't cheap at all compared to Chinatown .
This place is classy , chic , the service is warm and hospitable , and the food is outstanding .
The service is pretty good .
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
This restaurant was way overhyped .
I will be going back and heartily recommend it !
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
Service is top notch .
This place is great .
The Dancing , White River and Millenium rolls are musts .
If you go to Roth 's try to be served by Mike , he is GREAT !!
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere .
Most importantly , food is excellent .
Will absolutely visit again .
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .
It was divine melts in your mouth .
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service .
Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) .
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment .
It is simply amazing .
Try the ribs , sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice .
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off â€“
My bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie .
it is not consistent .
There was no ambiance .
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .
We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi .
Once you try it for a special occasion beware . . you ca n't stop !
Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .
And the food is fantastic .
This place survives on reputation alone .
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .
We will be back .
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED .
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about .
Maybe tomorrow ; - )
Service is not what you are coming here for ...
Came looking for this place because I heard good things .
I would highly recommend it .
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ...
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food .
I often find myself with time to kill in Times Square , which is a shame since I do n't love this area .
They have it all -- great price , food , and service .
Service - friendly and attentive .
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street .
The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .
Highly recommended !
Go spend your money somewhere that really wows you .
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .
Not impressed with the food .
Even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .
It just was n't Thai .
Best Indian Restaurant in the City
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience ! )
Unfortunately , we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport .
Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .
lobster was good , nothing spectacular .
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we 've ever had .
Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price .
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC .
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe 's .
I 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips .
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .
Ca n't wait to go back .
Worth a visit .
I read about this place in Time Out magazine .
From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
Ruby Foo 's is a tourist trap .
The food -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying .
Because of the delicate thin crust , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes .
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !
It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .
Kudos to Po !
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !
Rosario 's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence .
Solid wine list , knowledgeable staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever-changing menu keep us coming back .
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese .... both very tasty .
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor .
Our teenage kids love it , too .
Went there for an office lunch .
Old school meets New world .
There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
I highly recommend it .
Once for dinner and once for brunch .
The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant .
Will not be back .
How have I never been to Agave before ?
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 !
I absolutely suggest this place .
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
I take all my NYC guests to VT 's .
My friend had a burger and I had these wonderful blueberry pancakes .
If you love seafood , you would love this place !
But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the prices are a bit over the top .
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
We 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .
I have been to spice three times - twice during lunch and once at dinner .
Faan is sooo good .
I 've enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we 've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish ( I 'm a daring eater but not THAT daring ) .
Average cake thats been courted by a LOT of hype .
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .
The service was great as well .
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops .
Good , fast service .
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
My GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it .
A great addition to Smith Street : finally , a place that 's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots .
IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL .
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .
And forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either .
Nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 3.25 too .
Saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .
Great beer selection too , something like 50 beers .
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
esp . during happy hour !
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .
I really liked this place .
keep up the good work .
What a great place !
Do n't go alone --- even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods .
Otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .
Went to Village last night for my birthday .
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited .
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
Go here .
This place has the best sushi in the city .
The design of the space is good .
Not worth it .
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
it helps if you know what to order .
The food now is inconsistent .
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .
Just wish they 'd expand .
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away .
Stick to the items the place does best , brisket , ribs , wings , cajun shrimp is good , not great .
I got hair in my food 2 times of then !
The prices were fantastic .
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .
the waitstaffs are nice though .
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .
BUT not in a good way .
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
Best Taiwanese food in NY !
This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York .
Do n't waste your time , or money !!
Not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary .
Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I do n't have to rush off to a show .
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
It is thick and slightly soggy .
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout ... Lamb Chops , Veal Chops , Rabbit , the potato gratin , on and on and on ...
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
great experience overall .
at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous .
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
The service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
Definite go if you 're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad .
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; salads-all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day ( they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot ) .
The frizzy retro girl ( with winged / Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .
Its good to go there for drinks if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year .
I 've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens .
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
Do n't waste your time or your money .
Le Pere Pinard has a $ 15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding .
Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and service are right on target .
Saturday , Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us .
Did I mention that the coffee is OUTSTANDING ?
The gnocchi literally melts in your mouth !
Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating .
I do not recommend .
The waitstaff are all very busy , it 's not outstanding service , but I 've never been dealt with rudely .
Instead of wasting your time here : SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD .
you guys rock .
But if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food
I love the atmorphere @ peep !
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .
Had a great experience at Trio ... staff was pleasant ; food was tasty and large in portion size - I would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto .
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place ( he painted the ballato 's sign in the window ) .
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal .
But I 'd go back
Our food was great too !
personally i say save your money .
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .
This place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts .
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .
The staff greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent .
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
( Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .
great food
Okay service .
Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space .
The place was quiet and delightful .
I was highly disappointed by their service and food .
Not a great place for family or general dining .
My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !
My order is on my table even on a busy friday night within 10 minutes ( at the most ) of hanging up the phone .
Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine .
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n't seen in a while .
Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC .
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .
This place has great indian chinese food .
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
P.S. Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
Most importantly , it is reasonably priced .
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .
Although small , it has beautiful ambience , excellent food ( the catfish is delicious - if ya do n't mind it a lil salty ) and attentive service .
Odd for Ave B , not just odd , The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .
An awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .
It had been awhile and I forgot just how delicious crepes can be .
my picks : Guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source ( special menu ) .
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .
My fiance and I recently wanted to see the city and deceided to take a dinner cruise .
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT .
My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I could n't believe the food .
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .
If it 's just a quick martini at the bar ( which I recommend Jeffery 's ) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !
We had tons of great food , wine , and desserts .
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
Great find in the West Village !
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food , and there was no one to recommend any wine .
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .
But they do .
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
What more could you want ?
I just do n't understand all the hype ...
Once for dinner and once for brunch .
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli .
I go twice a month !
Anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .
You 'll adore it .
Harumi Sushi has the freshest and most delicious array of sushi in NYC .
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .
So , a little inconsistency there but either way , both pizzas were really good .
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .
However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !
i 'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i 've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning .
The location is perfect .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination .
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
This is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .
Much more reasonably priced too !
The DJ is awesome , I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back .
The food is wonderful , artfully done and simply delicious .
The decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining .
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events .
Was surprisingly disappointed .
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
The service was superb , they treat you like family .
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .
The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to .
This place is not worth the prices .
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer ....
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .
I 'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good .
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at ' Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip .
Very pleased
Just straight up cheap , good food .
Delish and made to your liking !
The downstairs bar scene is very cool and chill ...
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .
I wish they would change back to what it was before .
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .
Based on a visit a month ago , I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .
Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .
The food is just OKAY , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only dish that 's really good .
Why make a reservation if you are n't going to keep it ?
Our waiter was horrible ; so rude and disinterested .
I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience .
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
I never had an orange donut before so I gave it a shot .
They all know you .
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
How do you rate home ?
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .
That 's why you have to pay more for that .
Never got an explanation as to what was going on .
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason .
I would go back tho .
This place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi .
Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment .
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
But for the Shabu Shabu , you wo n't find much better in NY .
if you 're daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it 's wonderful !
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening .
Another great place to take out-of-towners !
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .
While I 'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business !
After the review I treked into Brooklyn .
Bring your appetites .
I pray it stays open forever .
IT WAS HORRIBLE .
The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting , without it trying to be that .
Best hot dogs in the tri-state area .
Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
Go here .
It was such a fantastic dining experience , that I returned again the same week .
We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .
Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
they live up to the thai way of living .
However , the food and service and dramatically lacking .
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
The food tasted very good .
It 's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street .
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .
Great deal !
My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly !
go here for the drinks !
I started going to dosa hut more after that .
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
Located at the end of a magnificent block .
We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious !!!
My entire family was horrified .
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .
Best meal in a long time !
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .
I 'll be back soon .
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions .
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
The freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery .
The menu , which changes seasonally , shows both regional and international influences .
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .
What more can you ask for ?
but I would n't wan na live there .
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts ....
All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .
The food 's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine .
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .
And cheap !
The food really is n't very good and the service is terrible .
Ruth , mother of the Bride
The lox is always fresh too .
Not a great place for family or general dining .
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive .
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
Service is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the price .
My co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery , only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered .
The food 's as good as ever .
Love the scene first off - the place has a character and nice light to it . . very fortunate , location wise .
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .
Sit back in one of those comfortable chairs .
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .
The food is excellent !
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .
The staff is very friendly .
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef Yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte .
I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !!
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation ( if possible )
Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .
I 'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away ... been going there on and off for a year now and it 's really my fave hang out in the city .
We 've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we 've been lucky ?
Not only would I not recommend Jimmy 's restaurants to friends , I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but .
Indo Chinese food , pretty good ...
It 's very spicy but not offensive .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
though the service could be better ( possibly due to more than one very large group in the house ) , it is very cordial and warm , as is the general clientele .
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .
first it took us a long time to find the place .
I was n't here for the pizza so I ca n't comment on that yet but what I had was very good .
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
Service was among the best I have ever had in NYC .
$ 500 included :
The specials are usually quite good too .
For $ 600 ( the most we have ever paid ) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance .
You 'll see a lot of people eating there after church .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
Enjoy !
I 've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST .
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price
The food at this place is ' gourmet ' Indian cuisine .
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .
The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .
Another welcome addition to the neighborhood .
Try the cheesecake !
And it was quick which is very important .
To speak of the Park Side , words can not describe .
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch .
An excellent service
Authentic bistro !
Also they were $ 15 each !
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
Helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .
I loved it and would go again .
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine 's dinner .
Highly recommended .
Ahhh ...
Horrible .
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that do nâ€™t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !
Try green curry with vegetables .
The food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city .
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .
I never had anything I did n't like here .
If you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards .
I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant .
Everyone must come here at least once .
It is also extremely well priced .
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
My goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?
I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .
And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .
Good food .
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
Overall , worht every penny .
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .
Ciao Bella
I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there .
Seriously , this place kicks ass .
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .
Certainly not the best sushi in New York , however , it is always fresh , and the place is very clean , sterile .
And all of that wo n't break your bank !
We were very disappointed .
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good food .
No apologies during restaurant week .
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again , I will certainly stop by .
I had the cod with paella ( spicy and very filling , I 'm a big eater and could only eat half ) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips ( again , a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries ) .
It was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-I 've had better for less elsewhere !
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
The pasta primavera was outstanding as well , lots of fresh veggies .
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
We had a girls ' night dinner here for restaurant week .
service was efficient courteous .
However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .
The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth .
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess .
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
Our experience did not ever get any better .
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
The place is a lot of fun .
They used shredded cheese on top !
The steak is good , the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great .
The food was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price ( including 2 drinks , $ 100/person ) ...
I am Indian , and I have tried many Indian places in NY .
uni from maine vs california , sea vs freshwater eel ) to get a good taste comparison .
A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
Decor is charming .
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
Look , the appetizers were really good .
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .
Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night .
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .
You would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .
Even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in New York pizza restaurants ) .
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .
And where does Patis go wrong ; no where .
My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great !
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .
We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
Drinks way over priced .
It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
It just was n't Thai .
It 's only $ 1.95 for a regular slice and $ 4.00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms .
Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .
I had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 .
Just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
We will be back .
I am completely hooked on this place , it is ridiculous .
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal .
We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning .
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .
I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL ( OR BAD SERVICE ) @ PIGALLE .
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
Restaurant with a view
The Thai food is good .
I do n't get it either .
My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the Tostada de Tinga ...
Going to Ballato 's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen , an absolute delight !
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .
Great food , great lay out and awesome service .
Really though , where 's the seasoning ?
Our food was great too !
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food .
Service was good and food is wonderful .
Their duck here is also absolutely delicious .
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
Oh , and there 's hookah .
you should travel from the Bronx to try it ...
Patsy 's Pizza = true love
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for ?
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth 's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites .
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
The wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she 's - way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way ) .
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way .
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
I liked the beer selection !
I thought the restaurant was nice and clean .
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato ( with espresso ) , which were tasty , but I thought a bit overpriced .
I agree .
But , nothing stands out about the cooking .
If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan .
Great food .
Excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .
The staff is unbelievably friendly , and I dream about their Saag gosht ... so good .
We parked on the block of Nina 's the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizzas .
Do n't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .
Slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .
A defitely must visit .
And the staff is also young , energeic and hot !!!!
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well , I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick !
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .
Good creative rolls !
It does n't look like much on the outside , but the minute you walk inside , it 's a whole other atmosphere .
When she complained , the waitress said , Sorry .
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .
Try the chocolate mud cake ( warmed ) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato .
Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .
Looking from the outside in , one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall ( really , that 's what it is ) .
It hits the spot every time
But $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include Wine ?
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
The wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindly little european town .
Delicious crab cakes too .
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .
the teas are great and all the sweets are homemade .
so i thought why not change it up a bit .
They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .
Dessert : pure disaster .
We 've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .
Amazing !
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring .
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( do n't waste any of your calories ) and service was poor .
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size .
But WARNING : to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations .
Casablanca servces delicious falafel , tabouleh , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .
I paid just about $ 60 for a good meal , though : )
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!!
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .
The only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time .
I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed .
Chinatown definitely has better quality with cheaper prices .
A beautiful atmosphere , perfect for drinks and/or appetizers .
Decent wine at reasonable prices .
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .
At the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup .
If you 're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good service , definitely visit Curry Leaf .
Southern Indian cuisine is still there , too .
The absolute worst service I 've ever experienced and the food was below average ( when they actually gave people the meals they ordered ) .
Again , the waitress was awesome .
Believe me , they live up to the name .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
The people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .
fine dining restaurant quality .
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit .
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation ) .
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
We were so happy with our food and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill .
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
Try sushimi cucumber roll .
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .
Highly Highly Highly recommended !
The atmosphere is warm , comfortable , artsy and sexy .
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around ) .
Prices are very good .
After we ate our appetizers ( which took all of 8 minutes ) we ordered another round of Brahma 's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .
Would n't recomend it for dinner !
Ca n't wait to go back .
Again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here .
They are located in the middle of Chinatown !
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
The service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food ( horrible bartenders ) , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters ( this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff ) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game .
Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .
If you do n't like it , I do n't know what to tell you .
For an untrendy rip-off - eat here .
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
You wo n't be dissapointed .
I plan on stopping by next week as well .
I 've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I 've been sitting there while he lectured another customer .
Raymond the bartender rocks !
Bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !
Love Pizza 33 . .
And I 've been to many NYC delis .
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the food .
We ordered lamb which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome .
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
The service is great ( maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention ) , the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good ...
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
Everyone is welcomed in as family .
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
Last time I went here , the waitress did n't come back after taking our order .
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
A few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside .
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
Definitely Highly NOT recommended .
It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool .
Try the homemade breads .
supercilious scorn is in .
Very " normal Indian food " , but done really well .
it is not consistent .
Note that they do not serve beer , you must bring your own .
You ca n't go wrong here .
The $ 72 Delmonico steak had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order .
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
Pizza here is consistently good .
Go hungry and enjoy .
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party .
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic ...
Also they were $ 15 each !
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices .
Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
I for one will never patronize them again .
Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $ 12 dollars and the mushrooms where $ 12 for about 1oz .
Always busy but fast moving .
Indoor was very cozy and cute .
Over priced , overrated .... stay away !
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
The red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .
We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
The waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large .
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean .
We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .
Food does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there 's a high turnover so its pretty fresh .
Terrible would be a compliment !
I noted it was crossed off on the bill .
Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food .
The best dessert , a chocolate and peanut butter tart , is n't particularly Hawaiian , but it 's a small world when it comes to sweets .
so delicious !!!!!!
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .
The food is average : breakfast food , soups , salads , sandwiches , etc .
As much as I like the food there , I ca n't bring myself to go back .
I 've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants .
Sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly .
Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy , laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint .
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .
The sushi is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied .
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat .
I generally like this place .
but the food was delicious .
Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !
So rude !!!
I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .
Service not the friendliest to our " large party " !
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go .
Still we keep going back : )
We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived .
The counter service is bad .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
The waiters are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you .
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .
The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past .
Also , the staff is very attentive and really personable .
Over 100 different choices to create your own .
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .
This is , by far , my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often !
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
... and that 's saying a lot .
We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant .
But for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
Being from the south , there are n't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz 's Deli .
P.S. Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .
during busy hrs , i recommend that you make a reservation .
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table .
I absolutely Loved this place .
The waitstaff is solicitous and friendly and always seems glad to see us , and the food is wonderful , if not stunningly creative .
From the moment you walk in , you feel like you 're in the perfect place .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot .
Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .
I am French and I really felt like home !!!
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
It was delicious and large !
delicious .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
I look forward to eating here again
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
not only is the food
Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback !!
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine !!!
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
Had a great meal there this weekend before heading to the movies !
Great place , great value .
I was pleasently surprised at the taste .
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry - interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat .
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .
We requested they re-slice the sushi , and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes .
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face .
Moving on .
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
The prices are not terrible .
Wretched and retching
Definitely not worth the price !
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .
I went this past Saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes .
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
If this restaurant was in Manhattan , I would definitely go more often .
Try the sea bass .
I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .
I 'm telling you ...
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .
I definitely would n't go back .
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared .
Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .
WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH OUR CHOICE .
Not impressed with the food .
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .
We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .
I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
The lamb was tender so full of flavor , the dessert was divine !!
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
You 'll be ther for every anniversary , birthday , valentines day ...
The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited .
The overall price tag was very very expensive , something I did expect .
Food was okay , nothing great .
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !
Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave.
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .
This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come .
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .
My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended .
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out !!!!
The service was very attentive and very generous .
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews .
Bottom line : B + for the food , F for the service .
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .
Pizza was a little soggy .
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .
Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good .
It 's the perfect restaurant for NY life style , it got cool design , awsome drinks and food and lot 's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar ...
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
Great burgers , grilled cheeses and french fries .
If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .
The entree was also very good .
Have to tell you : Not at all impressed .
The sushi is reasonably priced and fresh .
Maybe it 's that most of Dumont 's patrons are younger and have lower expectations , but I can not recommend Dumont .
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .
The food is amazing !!!!
The service was ok .
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .
I 've been coming here on and off for the past five years and I have to say that La Lanterna has never , ever dissapointed me .
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .
I do nâ€™t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I â€™ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .
If you 're looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to Del Frisco 's !
A nice find in the neighborhood .
DO N'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS ON THE BLOCK WERE LIKE BUT WE WERE PLEASED WITH OUR CHOICE .
Amazing food .
The lunch special is an asbolute steal .
Excellent experience .
What a difference , the service was very comforting and the food was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list .
The pastas were pretty good .
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic .
And amazingly cheap .
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated .
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had !
Hats off to the chef .
The food is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .
And these are not small , wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real , full sized patties .
The wine list is excellent .
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .
The place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty .
If you want good tasting , well seasoned latin food eat at Cabana and you ca n't go wrong .
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .
Of course , it is crowded but who cares .
Whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective .
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter does n't mean we should be automatically impressed .
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast .
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too .
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
Its not the same if you have to sit inside .
Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case .
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day .
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice .
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
Service was also very good .
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !
For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .
One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
If you 'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , Long Tan is a good place on the slope .
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .
I ca n't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of foods , it was impossible to criticize the food .
The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
I trust the people at Go Sushi , it never disappoints .
If that 's a problem , go to McDonald 's and destroy your insides .
( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal .
Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food .
Both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing .
For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !
Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out .
Got club soda , filled with ice , no lime .
The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
Overall I was impressed and will return , it 's a great QPR ( Quality to Price Ratio ) .
I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .
I highly recommend this restaurant !!
Not only was the sushi fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy ( try the duck !
Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best ( I hope Mom does n't read this ! ) .
I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
I wish I COULD be refunded !
Planet Thai is great !
This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City , not just Brooklyn ...
The filet mignon dish was superb !
We began with the cheese fondue ( the artisanal blend ) and added apples and kielbasa to dip .
I would highly recommend this place !
However , the service is absolutely horrible .
The place is clean , and if you like soul food , then this is the place to be !
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery .
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .
My friend 's food was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like ( aND look like ) .
Just go in and sample the greatest french food west of Daniel .
Thank You Emilio .
both are very reasonably priced ( around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch ) , and are delicious and filling .
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
Fast service .
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , " oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier " No apology , nothing .
Cute and decorative .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
Avoid this place !
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
It 's true , you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas .
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .
The service was outstanding .
The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say " I 've been to the four seasons restaurant " .
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
Amazing !
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it !
Food is excellent .
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work .
Definitely try the taglierini with truffles - it was incredible .
This is the first time Citysearch did ' t call it right .
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
Went with mommy ( the only person who could afford taking me here ) .
The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food .
Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .
They could n't even make a salad that was appealing .
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I 'm not sure which dim sum dish it was .
I 've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago .
I 've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food .
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices .
I ca n't wait to go back .
The pizza was really good .
You ca n't go wrong with this place .
The food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , ( WOW ) you 'll need no more .
I 'll be back for sure .
this one is definintely my least favorite .
Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee .
We had the most wonderful waitress .
I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
However , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street .
Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 .
While the food was good ( certainly no Il Mulino ) the service was horrendous .
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
Don Pedro 's is one of my favorite restaurants .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .
The food now is inconsistent .
A hearty two thumbs up !
Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
It 's just good food , nothing more and that 's all we want !
i would just ask for no oil next time .
The staff is also attentive and friendly .
Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .
The owner truly caters to all your needs .
Dessert was also to die for !
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
Recommendations , of course , are required !
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size .
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice .
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces .
We left , never to return .
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .
We visit at least once a month .
In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
The fried rice is amazing here .
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
Tends to turn people away .
Something about them being busy with holiday party 's .
We thought the dessert would be better , Wrong !
Go hungry and enjoy .
Excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
Here 's to the fake fish tanks too ...
Tasty steak , pork loin , the works .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
Great wine list and great cocktail menu .
If you are a Tequila fan you will not be disappointed .
The fried rice is really good too .
The service we experienced was friendly and good .
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .
Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .
By far , the best pizza in Manhattan .
Excellent lunch buffet for only $ 6.95 .
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate dÃ©cor will make you feel like you â€™re no longer in the city .
jazz singer had a nice voice + she made us all get up to dance to shake some cals to eat some more .
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .
I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC .
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings !
NO more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff .
The atmosphere was nice but it was a little too dark .
The food was good too .
it helps if you know what to order .
Go for it !
The photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge steaks , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .
Even my Indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .
Unfortunately , unless you live in the neighborhood , it 's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure .
They charge $ 6.00 for rice .
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .
When he 's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms , he 's visiting the regulars ( a growing legion ) and checking on newcomers .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
The menu may be small , but everything on it is delicious .
Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .
The food is authentic Italian - delicious !
Weekends can get crowded , but still highly recommended .
Loved it !
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .
They sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc .
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food .
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
Service was good and so was the atmosphere .
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ' that ' couple .
They are the best bagels I 've had .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip .
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .
Suan has challenged this loyalty .
You will be very happy with the experience .
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .
Also very inexpensive .
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .
Service was also very good .
Bravo , Blue Hill !
Not what I wanted to hear .
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk .
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
I am a die hard peep lover .
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise .
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
It 's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger .
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but .
We loved it and will go back !
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .
The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
I go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .
Was surprisingly disappointed .
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC .
Do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full .
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
We were wondering why they were there to make our dining experience miserable ?
This place does n't make any sense
Not enough wines by the glass either .
The food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .
We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than Roth 's we are always disappointed .
You 'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .
We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful .
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .
but the service was a bit slow .
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York .
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards , but it is cozy and the food is simply GREAT .
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
enough said !
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
Ballato 's is consistently delicious authentic italian food .
I 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( I live on UWS ) .
GO HERE .
The freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery .
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare .
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE .
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
Food portion was SMALL and below average .
The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened .
This time , I prefer not to go into detail .
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .
The bill is approximately $ 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks .
Went there last night for 2 year anniversery , and was n't all that impressed .
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
Great food at reasonable prices .
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
Overall , this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
I tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
I look forward to eating here again
The room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac !
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS .
The staff is no nonsense .
You have to increase the service a lot .
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!

On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
it was a very warm experience .
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .
The selection of food is excellent ( I 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants ) , and the atmosphere is great .
Tiny restaurant with very fast service .
Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - does n't meet the bill .
I can understand the prices if it served better food , like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area .
Like others have said , do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes , a busy restaurant may require you to wait .
I am going to the mid town location next .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
Be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it !
The food was boring and expensive .
This place has the best Indian food in New York , hands down .
Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' perks ' were great .
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .
$ 160 for 2 filets , 2 sides , an appetizer and drinks .
Zero ambiance to boot .
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter 's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , carrots and other vegetables and spices .
It 's cute and simple and I loved it .
Give it a try and enjoy .
The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well .
This place is Italian , not French .
You can do it here .
The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge .
Being a vegan myself , I 've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in Manhattan -- and Zen Palate is easily my favorite .
Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
Service was prompt and courteous .
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .
Everytime my husband and I go there , we are never disappointed .
The food 's as good as ever .
Katz 's deli is a great NY experience .
A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .
Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joe 's may not be your favorite .
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers .
I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .

To	O
be	O
completely	O

the	O
only	O
redeeming	O
factor	O
was	O
the	O
food	B-ASP

which	O
was	O
above	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
uniformly	O
exceptional	O

with	O
a	O
very	O
capable	O
kitchen	B-ASP

all	O
I	O
can	O

is	O
that	O
they	O

the	O

It	O
is	O
very	O

(	O
usually	O
the	O
waiters	B-ASP
are	O
kind	O
enough	O
to	O
split	O

you	O

was	O
n't	O
all	O
that	O
impressed	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
rather	O
pathetic	O
that	O
it	O
took	O
them	O
over	O
an	O
hour	O
to	O
seat	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
promptly	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
reservations	B-ASP
,	O
however	O
after	O
that	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
was	O
slow	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
I	O
was	O
slightly	O
skeptical	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
sushi	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
NYC	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
really	O
also	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
,	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-ASP
are	O
friendly	O
.	O

Suan	O
was	O
a	O
recommendation	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
glad	O
we	O
heeded	O
.	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
pretty	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
flavorless	O
and	O
the	O
portions	O
very	O
small	O
,	O
including	O
dessert	B-ASP
.	O

We	O
visit	O
at	O
least	O
once	O
a	O
month	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
set	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
small	O
street	O
it	O
's	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
traffic	B-ASP
noise	I-ASP
.	O

Also	O
,	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
popular	O
with	O
families	O
,	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
bothered	O
by	O
children	O
running	O
loose	O
like	O
wild	O
animals	O
,	O
come	O
later	O
at	O
night	O
to	O
avoid	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
'll	O
keep	O
this	O
short	O
.	O

I	O
felt	O
as	O
though	O
I	O
were	O
eating	O
in	O
Paris	O
.	O

Lived	O
in	O
Shanghai	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
thought	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
comparable	O
to	O
the	O
flagship	O
Green	O
Bo	O
restaurant	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
Cafe	O
St.	O
Bart	O
's	O
for	O
their	O
food	B-ASP
,	O
the	O
ambience	B-ASP
and	O
wonderful	O
service	B-ASP
.	O

However	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
worth	O
a	O
special	O

Nice	O

Gigino	O

it	O

The	O

With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.
Plenty of choices to make your own creation.
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.
What a ripoff!
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe's.
The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair.
You order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.
the turkey burgers are scary!
Nice place though.
The service, however, was a bright flower in a garden.
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
I think the stuff was better than Disney.
Avoid at all costs.
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.
The wait staff is very friendly, if not overly efficient.
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.
For the quality of food, a little too expensive.
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events.
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
Very cozy and warm inside.....
Please take my advice, go and try this place.
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.
Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
The sushi was awful!
The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant".
They are the best bagels I've had.
Will give it another chance before I write it off.
The lunch special is an asbolute steal.
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos.
The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen.
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table.
At 6:30, we were the third party there.
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!
I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
I absolutely love this place!!!
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch.
Highly Highly Highly recommended!
What a pleasant surprise!
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town.
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
Meal was very expensive for what you get.
Its located in greenewich village.
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money.
I have been twice to this restaurant.
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably.
both are very reasonably priced (around $8 for dinner and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling.
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt.
Two words: Free wine.
There is nothing more pleasant than that.
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
Our teenage kids love it, too.
I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.
The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful.
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with crowds or lines.
Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
I will go back to Suan soon!
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.
still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer...
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me.
I would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not THAT great.
The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
I highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine, but also for its friendly owners and staff.
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much... and we're repeat customers.
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
Great selection of wine, and seafood.
Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life.
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals.
Try ordering from the regular menu, then you would not regret!
If your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in Time Sq...
A real dissapointment.
This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York.
The food was good.
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.
The place is beautiful!
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread).
The flavors robust and subtle.
I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.
I've been here twice now.
Montparnasse's desserts--especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart--are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip.
Try it side by side and there's no comparison.
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
Beautiful experience.
All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 
Food is excellent.
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
The food did take a few extra minutes to come, but the cute waiters' jokes and friendliness made up for it.
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.
We were very impressed with the food and value.
Finally!
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
Good food at the right price, what more can you ask for.
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.
Great food!
I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.
We went there, no one greeted us.
i would just ask for no oil next time.
Good, fast service.
What for?
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.
Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare.
Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!
Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing.
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night.
Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.
My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.
When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside, she recommended that we go to this restaurant.
The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.
I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.
As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.
This place is always very crowded and popular.
delicious.
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.
The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.
Bleecker St Pizza is the best!
I highly recommend it.
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess, it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well.
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards, but it is cozy and the food is simply GREAT.
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
Service- friendly and attentive.
During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.
The staff should be a bit more friendly.
The food was well prepared and the service impecable.
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable prices.
IT IS WHAT MODERN CUISINE IS ALL ABOUT.
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough. 
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
Indo Chinese food, pretty good...
This is a real gem of a place.
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.
The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific!
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)  
Great Atmosphere
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.
but their mac cheese was YUMMY!
Great food (spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom.
Don't waste your time or your money.
If you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!
Would NEVER go back
Food is great.
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.
It is thick and slightly soggy.
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations.
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.
We had fun eating in there, we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning!
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.
Love Pizza 33..
I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu.
My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar.
I loved it and would go again.
The best!
I've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST.
I didn't take a look at the rest menu, but the oysters were fantastic.
The place is clean, and if you like soul food, then this is the place to be!
If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House.
Try the green curry!!!
A little crowded but they move that line really fast!
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.
I've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste.
The bagels are fabulous.
The place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.
The food is great (big selection, reasonable prices) and the drinks are really good.
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).
The downstairs bar scene is very cool and chill...
Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly, helpful, and willing to the extra mile for a customer.
Very, very nice
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.
Amazing!
Highly recommended!
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.
We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more.
While the prices are nothing special, the portions are huge.
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.
This place doesn't make any sense
And where does Patis go wrong; no where. 
In addition to great hot dogs, DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins, a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham.
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions.
You can't go wrong here.
What more can you ask for?
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.
Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.
The food was very good, but not very thai.
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
I couldn't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher.
I am going to the mid town location next.
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.
The owner and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable.
However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade.
IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL.
The menu is great, with a good selection, and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious.
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.
I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.
The sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).
I am going to the mid town location next.
Best things to order are from the grill (Churrasco and Ribs).
This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.
We will be back.
And really large portions.
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
Consistently good Japanese Tapas.
Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much.
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out.
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.
The food was so-so.
last Tuesday for a late lunch with a friend.
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!
The food there are sastifying.
Finally, I got sick of the bad service, obnoxious smirks, and snotty back talk.
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!
I went here in the afternoon with a friend.
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.
I ordered from here last week.
Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?
All I can say is WOW!
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.
Nice value.
I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.
It's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book.
They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.
Another great thing about Glechik-everything is very cheap!
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
This place was not ALL THAT!
Everyone was more then happy with his choices.
Food was OK - fish was cooked well.
menu - uneventful, small.
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.
Service was good and food is wonderful.
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them.
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd.
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
Stay far away from this place.
I asked for seltzer with lime, no ice.
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
Don't go with a larger group than 4! 
You should pass on the calamari.
Prices are in line.
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.
Odd for Ave B, not just odd, The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.
The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list.
That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had.
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food.
This place is not worth the prices.
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
Reliable, Fresh Sushi
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!
This place...god where do i begin.
To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.
We were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow.
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.
If you're looking for a great meal at a decent price, go to Del Frisco's!
Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.
My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES.
Great staff.
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!
you should travel from the Bronx to try it...
Great neighborhood joint.
Great pizza and fantastic service.
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here.
I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited.
several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.
I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn.
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.
Over 100 different choices to create your own.
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip.
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection.
Here's the thing, you're in the best city in the world for restaurants.
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).
What?
I think the stuff was better than Disney.
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
People are always friendly.
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.
Big and gawky on the outside.
I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.
The food is very good for it's price, better than most fried dumplings I've had.
Of course, it is crowded but who cares.
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.
I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies.
You can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.
Arigato Gozimas Yuka!
Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.
I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC.
It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
We had a girls' night dinner here for restaurant week.
I have never in my life sent back food before, but I simply had to, and the waiter argued with me over this.
They outshine HH.
Too bad Latin Quarters closed.
I just don't understand all the hype...
I had the best ravioli ever.
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.
Terrible experience.
Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!
My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.
but the service was a bit slow.
Fantastic!
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
Ciao Bella
The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.
The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night.
The steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.
The food is definitely good, but I left a bit disappointed.
The food--though mostly deep-fried--is simple and satisfying.
Go here.
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.
The Thai food is good.
If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things.
You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown.
I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it's not a cheap night out...but it's SO worth it.
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
The food was bland oily.
During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.
When we sat, we got great and fast service.
What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way).
So eat fast and order a lot.
I've waited over one hour for food.
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.
Delicious, creative and fun.
Great food, great decor, great service.
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.
I lOVE THIS PLACE!
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
The service is good and the resturant is clean.
The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.
Definitely a neighborhood favorite.
This food is asian-air fusion.
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
i dont how this place is still running.
word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.
Restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place.
Not only was the waiter efficient and courteous, but also extremely helpful. 
fresh restaurant was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.
Once for dinner and once for brunch.
I hate this.
Service ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom.
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.
black white shakes came out good also.
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer....
Nothing against a good sales call, but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious.
Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.
It was pretty inexpensive too.
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
The owner truly caters to all your needs.
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.
Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable.
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
Too many other good places to have to settle.
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).
To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu.
Murray won't do it.
THe perfect spot.
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.
The Dim Sum was so-so, but not spectacular.
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.
We called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did. 
I'll be back for sure.
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city.
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.
The dim sum however was very good.
Good drink.
Our server was very helpful and friendly.
I've dined at Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience.
It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.
It's very spicy but not offensive.
Prices are very good.
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
get over it!
Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.
The design and atmosphere is just as good.
Just go in and sample the greatest french food west of Daniel.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food, as well the staff was freindly and knowledgable.
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.
The ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic.
fine dining restaurant quality.
The food is amazing!!!!
Stay with the roasted chickens and you'll be fine.
Prices are very good.
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples.
There are much better places in NY with better prices.
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice.
After the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!
Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
While their kitchen food is delicious, their Sushi is out of this world.
This is also where I was from.
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.
Not only do they have the best escargot in town,they always try to accomodate our toddler.
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive.
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming.
The menu may be small, but everything on it is delicious.
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks...  
We were less than impressed.
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants.
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli, I knew there was going to be good pizza!
If you want to save some money, don't go here.
delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.
Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.
I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.
We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some food?
However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.
I love the atmorphere @ peep!
love the food.
Planet Thai is great!
No thanks!!!
It's traditional, simple italian food.
The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber.
The food is great and reasonably priced.
This is the first place I've been that a runner remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.
Drinks got screwed up, she acted put upon.
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent.
We were charged full price.
Maybe it has improved since then?
Dishes denoted as "Roy's Classics" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs.
The sushi is reasonably priced and fresh.
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.
The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.
Based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for Dim Sum again.
We asked for beverages and never received them.
It was wonderful.
We visit at least once a month.
Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side.
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.
An excellent service
Now at the top of our list, Del Frisco's Steakhouse.
Nick Stef's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area, so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Herald's Square check it out!
The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.
The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead.
It is terrific, as is the value.
wow! how have i missed this one ,tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew.
Salads were fantastic.
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.
She replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded." 
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
Sandwiches, burgers and salads, like the lemon-dressed cobb, are classic successes.
My husband and I take out from here 3-4 times a month.
mojitos and the service are the best part in there
Everyone is welcomed in as family.
Their twist on pizza is heatlhy, but full of flavor.
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!
This time, I prefer not to go into detail.
We were pleasantly surprised.
Nice find.
The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
I plan on stopping by next week as well.
Stay away
great eats, good times.
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
How can hope to stay in business with service like this?
Bring your date and a bottle of wine!
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. 
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor.
As a long-time patron of Mamoun's, I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city.
skip dessert.
very good breads as well.
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating.
I'm partial to the Gnocchi.
Service was wonderful;
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout...Lamb Chops, Veal Chops, Rabbit, the potato gratin, on and on and on...
My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious, new summer menu at Artisanal last night.
We shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi.
The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.
The main course had an average portion, and was decent overall.
A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.
But the pizza is way to expensive.
But for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high.
As I made the title, it's an affordable restaurant for great taste.
Maggot in the food!
I thought this place was totally overrated.
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice.
Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.
Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that's all the service I need...
The 'kamasutra' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.
The other night we had the $30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of.
The pastas were pretty good.
If you love seafood, you would love this place!
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods, indian included, i made friends with this place long ago.
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
Wretched and retching
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.
I must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view.
The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.
I really liked this place.
Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor.
would NOT go back.
We had a good time.
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.
Before the place didn't call my attention.
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit.
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware.
The service was great, and they have a whole great deal for birthdays.
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.
Just not good at all.
Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
Good food at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date).
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix.
if your into thai..you cannot miss this great restaurant.
We will definitely go back.
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
I usually get one the Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup.
Really.
I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
I didn't go there for food so I can't comment.
We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious!
Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.
The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional.
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.
Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.
I've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants.
This isn't your corner Chinese food takeout.
When we sat, we got great and fast service.
The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to.
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).
for my birthday and we had an excellent time.
Give it a try and enjoy.
Drinks way over priced.
I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner, but nothing amazing.
Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.
I will have to say, this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite.
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though.
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else.
Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's.
Great food, great lay out and awesome service.
In fact, you can't miss it.
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!
I think the meatball parm is good.
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.
Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan.
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.
Pizza here is consistently good.
I am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings.
Although somewhat loud, the noise was minimally intrusive.
Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.
Go for the Seafood Paella for two.
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.
Excellent food for great prices
Overall a disappointing experience for that price category.
And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.
Tends to turn people away.
This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
i especially like their soft shell crab sandwich with fries.
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow.
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.
We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.
As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread, but all the bagles are unbeliavably good.
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
Waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well.
I've come here for casual lunches as well as for a friend's birthday and I always enjoy myself.
The food was great.
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day.
Horrible.
Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).
great food, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood...
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.
too large for just two people but nothing was left.
Avoid this place!
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.
While I'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
Don't waste money on decor.
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
So rude.
This place doesn't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does, but it should.
Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.
I live on the street this place is on.
if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!
perfect for a quick meal.
Overall a worthwhile experience.
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the prices.
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead, while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat.
Their sake martini is wonderful.
I had the mango chicken and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful.
It could have been handled better.
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
The price very reasonable.
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.
The menu has so many fish items and oysters.
It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.
Ciao Bella
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate, the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care.
The noodle and rices dishes taste great.
The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.
It was wonderful.
My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.
A real dissapointment.
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given.
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's.....
Even with John's and Joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself.
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.
Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip.
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.
The atmosphere was great.
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
Wow.
But the staff was so horrible to us.
The happy hour is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere.
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty, most delicious food and kept it that way...
go here for the drinks!
This is a nice sushi restaurant in Brooklyn that's located on 86 street, right underneath the train station.
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.
If presentation and service is your thing, then this magic show works.
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda.
Waitstaff are very friendly.
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...
Thank You Emilio.
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.
All toppings are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect, that one actually thinks of how it was made.
My husband and I enjoy Sangria.
All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts).
It's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.
You won't find that anywhere in Manhattan.
Went to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night.
Even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it.
All I can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you'll find in the city, though the quality is some of the best.
It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...
The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.
Obviously run by folks who know a pie.
We had a good time.
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must.
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.
I'm going back.
Their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender!
it was a very warm experience.
All the staff is absolutely professional!! 
bad staff
Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.
I've been several times and am totally smitten.
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.
The cold sesame noodles, which are a freebie when you order $10+, are delectable.
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting.
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees, including fresh seafood and huge steaks, there's also a couple of non-meat alternatives.
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES.
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.
Decent wine at reasonable prices.
this restaurant is absolutely beautiful.
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
it's good but, like the movie is never as good as the book, this is same analogy.
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. 
Not a great place for family or general dining.
Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about.
The staff is arrogant, the prices are way high for Brooklyn.
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.
Made my dining experience uncomfortable.
A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.
Restaurant with a view
Highly recommended to all!
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
I will be going back very soon.
The best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)
Food and service was okay.
I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.
The waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch!!!!!
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!
Service was good and so was the atmosphere.
The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.
Great pizza for lunch place.
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.
It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers.
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!
I would go back.
They all know you.
Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.
The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good.
Come on.
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
But that is highly forgivable.
Katz's deli is a great NY experience.
I can say that the wraps, burgers and salads were all fresh, tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.
Nice view of river and NYC.
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
Not a small feat for good french food in the area.
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.
I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.
Overall, this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent.
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.
Unfortunately, the food was NOT something to get worked up about.
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.
Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.
Try the Times Square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka (also available without vodka.)
Very excited to hear that short-term Chef Jason Narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record.
Also good for client lunch meetings, esp.
Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait.
In about 12 minutes, the thing is gone.
I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.
The staff is courteous and friendly.
As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were.
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location!
Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat.
Just ignore the trendy wannabes.
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
I highly reccomend the grand marnier shrimp, it's insanely good.
The steak melted in my mouth.
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you.
The place was nice and calm.
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.
Simple healthy unglamorous food cheap.
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!
I recommend this place to everyone.
Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels.
You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown.
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The
This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food.
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.
The pickles were great addition.
Went inside and I started to get excited.
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine.
Service was quick.
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
They were dry, stale and pretty flavorless.
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT's.
The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else.
For asian fusion, there are many places further downtown.
This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed!
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost.
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE!
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!
We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 
Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished.
Old school meets New world.
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
Finally!
I go twice a month!
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.
First off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong.
The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better.!!
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.
Trust me.
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.
Late nite omelletes are not good here, there is no variety!
I'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.
I was wrong.
The decor is what initially got me in the door.
Finally, after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be.
The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice.
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.
One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food.
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.
The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.
You will be satisfied.
For many people, this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic.
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
No refills on fountain drinks, though.
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
For all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City, I say, good - stay out.
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.
The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.
Great Indian food
This place has the best sushi in the city.
Not terrible, but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002.
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned.
If you want good tasting, well seasoned latin food eat at Cabana and you can't go wrong.
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.
It was good, but none of the flavors WOW.
Pricey, but worth a try, at least once.
The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.
I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.
It's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out.
Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious.
The fried calamari was even better!
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)
Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...
peppers, onions, relish, chilli, cheeses, you NAME it.
Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
Chef Waldy's always measures up.
Entrees include classics like lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana.
So close, but not good enough.
The service was dreadfully slow (the place was only half full) and a smile would have been nice...
Last memorial day, I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited.
We go often.
Our friends have not arrived yet.
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.
Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
When it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time, walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted...excuse me but isn't that his job???
For the location, the prices are very reasonable.
Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.
I've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table.
keep up the good work.
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.
It's like you are transported to the Italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques.
I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.
The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good.
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
It's really also the service, is good and the waiters are friendly.
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky.
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.
Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here.
All the food was hot tasty.
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .
However, being foodies, we were utterly disappointed with the food.
This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the food.
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
Try the homemade breads.
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.
Impressed...
Stay away if you're claustrophobic
Stay away from this place.
Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray's, Sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile, true love for his community, and let's not forget the Outstanding Pizza!
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average.
It's the conversations that make this a fun place to be.
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
Great value for the quality ingredients.
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.
He takes real pride in his food and his business.
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.
Also, the staff is very attentive and really personable.
Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.
My friends and I go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and everytime can't resist walking out ready to burst.
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!! 
Orsay, is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food, and French service as well.
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.
Yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations.
It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!
We've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner.
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.
The food was just OK, at least for what food was available.
If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$$ this is the place to be!!
Decor is nice though service can be spotty.
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.
Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
Delish and made to your liking!
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
It' only open for lunch but the food is so good!
Their coffee is quite good too!
I'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.
It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar...
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.
The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.
It's the kind of place I like to support!
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.
It's true, this place is not cheap.
Eat at your own risk.
The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.
Having moved I truly miss this place.
The food is great and the prices are reasonable.
Good for dates or with friends.
My husband and I moved to Nolita 6 years ago and for as long as we have lived here, Peasant has been our favorite!
At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES.
You would think they would make up for it with service, sadly, no.
The food now is inconsistent.
Had a great experience at Trio ... staff was pleasant; food was tasty and large in portion size - I would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto.
It was good, but was not what I thought it would be.
I plan on eating here more often.
I would highly recommend this place!
Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!
Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.
The food now is inconsistent.
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert, it was overpriced and fell short on taste.
This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.
Great food, amazing service, this place is a class act.
Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.
My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended.
Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible.
Love their drink menu.
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.
I felt as though I were eating in Paris.
The crispy chicken wasn't for us, though.
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
Forget the rush and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money.
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, Katz's has a charm about it.
I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.
And affordable.
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out.
The service, wine selection, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition.
Beef noodle soup is good as well.
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York.
Decor is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the wine list matches the food very well.
Is just the way it was in days gone by.
Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.
Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.
Can't wait to go back.
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $2.50.
I heard the lobster roll was excellent. 
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
Delivery service is great too.
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
I loved it and would go again.
The food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used.
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
It is terrific, as is the value.
I had roast chicken and a salad.
For two people with tip was less than $25 bucks.
Whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective.
my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.
A one women show!
Bon appettite!!
Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.
I've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I've never been disappointed.
despite the untasteful previous review...
Could have had better for 1/3 the price in Chinatown.
Wine list is extensive without being over-priced.
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.
since i was in the neighborhood, we made sure to give this a try.
I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it.
the food is decent.
Appetizers took nearly an hour.
Chance is a joke.
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.
This isn't a value joint.
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the steak dish which tends to be dry).
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
Excellent experience.
This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.
I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.
I am bringing my whole family back next time.
I went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it.
the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no reservations?
Everyone who works there (the host, the bartender, the servers) is so helpful.
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town.
I will NEVER return.
Try sushimi cucumber roll.
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people.
GO HERE.
The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.
short and sweet – seating is great:it's romantic,cozy and private.
they live up to the thai way of living.
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it.
I think this a a wonderful place.
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
This place was the worst.
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC.
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood).
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce.
However, it's not worth a special trip.
When she complained, the waitress said, Sorry.
If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas.
La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
Very good service and very good prices.
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.
The bruschetta and panini's are so yummy!
Service was among the best I have ever had in NYC.
$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner.
Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
I wish they would change back to what it was before.
The only downside... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time.
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night.
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening.
They charge different prices all the time.
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
Decor leaves something to be desired.
Zero ambiance to boot.
I'm in love with the lobster ravioli!
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy's!
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food.
Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating.
I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.
Hurley's is terrific!
This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion).
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).
This particular location certainly uses substandard meats.
Not impressed with the food.
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
Brava La Pizza Fresca!
The kitchen however, is almost always slow.
THE SERVICE IS PERFECT TOO  NOTHING WRONG IN THIS ITALIAN/FRENCH RESTAURANT
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.
I'd definitely go back again.
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.
My six year old loved it.
Hats off to the chef.
I am completely hooked on this place, it is ridiculous.
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
We didn't know if we should order a drink or leave?
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.
The service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave.
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.
The price very reasonable.
After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like.
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.
We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.
I also recommend the garlic knots.
The sake menu should not be overlooked!
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.
The pizza was really good.
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.
There was a heat problem to boot, so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats!
When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.
PERFECT FOR DATES!
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.
Kind, attentive wait staff.
The food is nothing like its menu description.
Always busy but fast moving.
Great atmoshere and worth every bit.
The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part.
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.
We were then shooed inside.
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good (kimono shrimp special was excellent) and has a great atmosphere.
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE.
It's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner.
This bar has it all - great drinks, cool atmosphere, excellent service and delicious food.
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.
The service was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order.
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
The appetizers are also delicious!
don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic.
Good creative rolls!
The fettucino alfredo was amazing.
They are amazing!
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
Definitely try the calamari, any pasta, or even the Sliced steak entree.
Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.
Waitstaff is great, very attentive.
It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.
I recieved prompt service with a smile.
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic.
Poor service and management
I would highly recommend it.
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores.
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
i would recommend reservations on weekends though.
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, as well as a great green tea tempura.
The bagel was huge.
I'm saving up for my next visit.
I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.
The lox is always fresh too.
Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead.
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner.
If you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you.
I've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious
The entree was also very good.
I haven't been to the other locations.
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.
Loved it
Nice for one time special occasion.
How is this palce still open?
Service was good and food is wonderful.
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster, a cold lobster salad that was magnificent.
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll.
The prices were fantastic.
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.
The food was absolutely amazing!!
Huge portions, great and attentive service, and pretty good prices.
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?
Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week.
Between my guest and I, we sampled at least 80% of the menu, and they were all hits.
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.
Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good.
The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes.
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked.
The service is pretty good.
Located at the end of a magnificent block.
They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare.
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
Some baby pizzas get their wish.
That's why you have to pay more for that.
The food arrived in about 15 minutes. 
the homemade Guacamole, the unbelievable entree, and thee most amazing deserts.
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
Ask for the round corner table next to the large window.
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome.
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.
I trust the people at Go Sushi, it never disappoints.
To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.
Great sushi experience.
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining.
I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
We could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.
He served me an Uni Hand roll, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN!
Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting.
Since we were already waiting so long, we felt we had no other choice but to accept it.
The level of rudeness was preposterous.
The service is great, my soup always arrives nice and hot.
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.
This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not.
Arigato Gozimas Yuka!
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.
Fish was overdone.
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.
(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!
And you never get the feeling that you need to leave.
My vegetable risotto was burnt, and infused totally in a burnt flavor.
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down.
Try sushimi cucumber roll.
We all felt it was worth it.
and you can't beat the prices.
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they're eaten.
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different.
Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant.
A must try!
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside.
Great food, great prices, great service.
Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side.
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces.
I have never had anything like it!
The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.
really depends on your luck!
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!
Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.
You won't be dissapointed.
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
but the service was a bit slow.
Buon appetito!
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack.
What's the difference between the two?
I am French and I really felt like home!!!
As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.
Save room for deserts - they're to die for.
Grilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing.
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.
For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion, I do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants.
The sushi was awful!
If you wrote a bad review, it's because you don't understand what Rao's is all about.
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!
The food was exceptional.
They make the best pizza in New Jersey.
This was a great surprise.
Keep up the good work guys!
The service is excellent and always informative without an air.
Best Chinese on the Upper East, prompt delivery, good value.
The staff is unbelievably friendly, and I dream about their Saag gosht...so good.
The menu is Prix Fixe, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is Well worth itsuperb food.
I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.
Somewhat pricey but what the heck.
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
But who says Murray's is anything about service.
Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat.
The service was pretty poor all around, the food was well below average relative to the cost, and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place.
Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else.
But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.
Also, the chick peas with shrimp (appetizer) is divine.
We had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing.
The tastes makes your mouth water for more.
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
I would highly recommend this place!
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.
We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts ....
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.
The food is terrible and overall, I would have to say avoid at all costs.
the service is prompt friendly.
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros.
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back.
Don't go there!
The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.
Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.
My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.
The atmosphere is great!!!
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night.
For being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.
not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere.
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!
The service was attentive, yet discreet.
The food is great, service is ok.
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.
Got a date? Go here!
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel.
Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.
Alone for 100 bucks, it is really overprice.
The dim sum here is only so-so.
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
Yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there.
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.
No plans to return anytime soon.
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well. 
We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.
Well...they can run but they can't hide.
Get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.
However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.
It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.
Horrible experience - stay away!
Get there before 7pm.
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions.
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
Off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants.
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza
Our friends have not arrived yet.
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh.
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
Whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were.
I just don't understand all the hype...
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.
Service was also very good.
If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.
The food is good, the teriyaki I recommend.
The meat dishes were only so-so.
Love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go.
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge!
I don't like Indian food too much and this was delicious, however you want to factor that into the equation.
(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.
went there last night with my coworker.
A glass of Leaping Lizard, a glass of prosecco, and the mussels had everything happy.
The food was spicy and delicious.
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied.
Everything about this restaurant was special.
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...
Even after a few bad evenings at Bardolino, I keep coming back.
This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.
Another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese.
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot.
Friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service.

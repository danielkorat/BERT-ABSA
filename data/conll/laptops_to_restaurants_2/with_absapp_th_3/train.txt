The	O
case	B-ASP

now	O
slightly	O

the	O

the	O

The	O

probably	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
in	O
a	O

so	O
if	O
your	O
planning	O
to	O
listen	O

I	O
suggest	O
you	O
get	O
something	O
better	O

the	O
screen	B-ASP

automatically	O

Speaking	O
of	O
the	O
browser	B-ASP
,	O
it	O
too	O
has	O
problems	O
.	O

It	O
absolutely	O
is	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
most	O
PC	O

but	O
the	O
ease	O
of	O
use	B-ASP
,	O
security	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
minimal	O
problems	O
that	O
have	O
arisen	O
make	O
it	O
well	O
worth	O
the	O
pricetag	B-ASP

Thus	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
carry	O
it	O
at	O
a	O
slanted	O
angle	O
,	O
the	O
screen	B-ASP
will	O
"	O
topple	O

or	O
"	O
slide	O

if	O
you	O

I	O
believe	O
with	O
Apple	O

you	O

It	O
seems	O
to	O

buying	O
it	O

It	O
just	O
works	B-ASP
out	O

the	O

you	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
cool	O
software	B-ASP
included	O
with	O
the	O
OS	B-ASP

It	O
is	O
absolutely	O
horrible	O
to	O

despite	O
all	O
its	O
so	O
called	O
advanced	O

The	O

this	O

But	O
,	O
like	O
I	O
said	O
before	O

the	O
only	O
reason	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
currently	O
have	O
a	O

because	O
all	O
of	O

The	O

nothing	O

But	O
not	O
in	O
this	O

I	O

really	O
impressed	O
with	O
the	O

for	O
the	O
price	B-ASP
of	O
the	O

My	O
only	O
complaint	O
is	O
the	O
total	O

of	O

come	O

the	O

but	O
its	O
very	O

The	O
flaws	O
are	O
,	O
this	O
computer	O
is	O
not	O
for	O
computer	O
gamers	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
OS	B-ASP
X.	I-ASP

It	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
use	O
,	O
has	O
great	O
screen	B-ASP
quality	I-ASP
,	O
and	O
every	O
so	O
light	O
weight	O
.	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O
white	O
Mac	O
computers	O
looked	O
dirty	O
too	O
quicly	O
where	O
you	O
use	O
the	O
mousepad	B-ASP
and	O
where	O
you	O
place	O
your	O
hands	O
when	O
typing	O

However	O
I	O
dealt	O
with	O
this	O
problem	O
for	O
over	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
hastle	O
then	O
I	O
have	O
EVER	O
had	O
with	O
anything	O
.	O

Was	O
n't	O
sure	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
like	O
it	O
much	O
less	O
love	O
it	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
local	O
best	O
buy	O
and	O
played	O
around	O
with	O
the	O
IOS	B-ASP
system	I-ASP
on	O
a	O
Mac	O
Pro	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
totally	O
unique	O
and	O
different	O
.	O

Finally	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
MAC	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
choices	O
of	O
which	O
PC	O
's	O
to	O
buy	O
and	O
EVERYONE	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
MAC	O
said	O
"	O
buy	O
a	O
MAC	O
"	O
.	O

Not	O
to	O
mention	O
sometimes	O
the	O
whole	O
charger	B-ASP
unit	I-ASP
will	O
decide	O
not	O
to	O
work	O
entirely	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
meant	O
to	O
purchase	O
the	O
NB205	O
and	O
bought	O
this	O
one	O
by	O
accident	O
(	O
long	O
story	O
)	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
easily	O
portable	O
and	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
everywhere	O
I	O
go	O
and	O
might	O
require	O
internet	O
access	O

After	O
5	O
months	O
of	O
failed	O
repairs	O
,	O
requested	O
a	O
full	O
refund	O
but	O
was	O
refused	O
and	O
it	O
still	O
is	O
not	O
repaired	O
and	O
Acer	O
is	O
indifferent	O
to	O
the	O
issue	O

It	O
is	O
light	O
and	O
the	O
battery	B-ASP
last	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
time	O

I	O
waited	O

waited	O
and	O
no	O

If	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
your	O
first	O

then	O
I	O
would	O
highly	O
suggest	O
that	O
you	O
take	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
class	O
that	O
they	O
offer	O
to	O

about	O

I	O
do	O

The	O

has	O
waned	O

now	O
I	O

cosmetically	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

previous	O

the	O
mac	B-ASP

a	O
clean	O
and	O
smooth	O
operating	B-ASP
system	I-ASP

The	O
newer	O
black	B-ASP
keyboard	I-ASP
took	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
previous	O
gray	O
one	O
which	O
looked	O
really	O
slick	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
great	O
notebook	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
fast	O
as	O
can	O
be	O
...	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O
...	O
well	O
worth	O
the	O
investment	O

I	O
want	O
the	O
portability	B-ASP
of	O
a	O
tablet	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
limitations	O
of	O
a	O
tablet	O
and	O
that	O
's	O
where	O
this	O

comes	O
into	O

My	O
computer	O
froze	O
on	O
several	O
occasion	O
,	O
had	O
buttons	B-ASP
that	O
randomely	O
would	O
fall	O
off	O
and	O
even	O
had	O
moments	O
when	O
the	O
computer	O
would	O
refuse	O
to	O
turn	O
on	O
at	O
all	O

So	O
I	O
called	O
customer	B-ASP
support	I-ASP
(	O
which	O
is	O
good	O
too	O
)	O
and	O
they	O
went	O
through	O
it	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
just	O
a	O
safety	O
feature	O
and	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
affect	O
performance	B-ASP
at	O
all	O
,	O
I	O
just	O
chose	O
to	O
hide	O
the	O
message	O

I	O
had	O
my	O
PC	O

for	O
3	O
years	O
and	O
going	O
to	O
a	O
MacBook	O

is	O
like	O
I	O
leaped	O
through	O

It	O
was	O
so	O
exciting	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
unwrapp	O
my	O
new	O

It	O
's	O
slow	O
and	O
one	O

i	O
hope	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
it	O

buy	O
something	O

I	O
will	O
not	O

in	O

this	O

rocks	O

Sadly	O
Apple	O
has	O
discontinued	O
this	O
MacBook	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
never	O
super	O
popular	O
since	O
it	O
fell	O
somewhere	O
in	O
between	O
the	O
cheapest	O

the	O
smaller	O
Pros	O

After	O
2	O

of	O

Asus	O
finally	O
sent	O
the	O
right	O
power	B-ASP

If	O
someone	O
called	O
me	O
an	O
Apple	O
Fanboy	O
...	O
it	O
would	O
make	O
sense	O

I	O
love	O
the	O
keyboard	B-ASP

Those	O
moments	O
in	O
thime	O
where	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
throw	O
something	O

I	O
wanted	O

it	O
on	O

The	O
smaller	O
size	B-ASP
was	O
a	O
bonus	O
because	O
of	O

I	O
could	O

I	O

many	O

what	O

that	O

the	O
